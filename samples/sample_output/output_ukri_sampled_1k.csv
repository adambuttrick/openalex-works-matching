In marine environments, some species such as those from the Crustacea and Cephalopoda that are principally monochromatic, have evolved to use this adaptation to discriminate objects across the whole visual field, an ability similar to our own use of colour vision. The performance of these polarization vision systems varies, and the few cephalopod species tested so far have notably acute thresholds of discrimination. However, most studies to date have used artificial sources of polarized light that produce levels of polarization much higher than found in nature. In this study, the ability of octopuses to detect polarization contrasts varying in angle of polarization (AoP) was investigated over a range of different degrees of linear polarization (DoLP) to better judge their visual ability in more ecologically relevant conditions. The 'just-noticeable-differences' (JND) of AoP contrasts varied consistently with DoLP. These JND thresholds could be largely explained by their 'polarization distance', a neurophysical model that effectively calculates the level of activity in opposing horizontally and vertically oriented polarization channels in the cephalopod visual system. Imaging polarimetry from the animals' natural environment was then used to illustrate the functional advantage that these polarization thresholds may confer in behaviourally relevant contexts.",False,0,,True,0

During geomagnetic storms, dayside magnetospheric ULF wave power is highly variable with strong enhancements that are dominated by elevated solar wind driving. However, the radial distribution of ULF wave power is complex ‐ controlled interdependently by external solar wind driving and the internal magnetospheric structuring. We conducted a statistical analysis of observed storm‐time ULF wave power from the Van Allen Probes spacecraft within 2012–2016. Focusing on the dayside (06 &lt; magnetic local time ≤ 15), we observe large enhancements across 3 &lt; L &lt; 6 and a steep L dependence during the main phase. We consider how accounting for concurrent magnetopause and plasmapause locations may reduce statistical variability and improve parameterization of spatial trends over and above using the L value. Ordering storm time ULF wave power by L provides the weakest dependences from those considered, whereas ordering by distance from the magnetopause is more effective. We also explore dependences on local plasma density and find that spatially localized ULF wave power enhancements are confined within high density patches in the afternoon sector (likely plasmaspheric plumes). The results have critical implications for empirical models of ULF wave power and radial diffusion coefficients. We highlight the necessity of improved characterization of the highly distorted storm‐time cold plasma density distribution, in order to more accurately predict ULF wave power.",False,0,,True,0

JAK3 has been proposed as an ideal target due to its expression being largely restricted to the immune system and its requirement for signalling by cytokine receptors using the common γ-chain. Unlike other JAKs, JAK3 possesses a cysteine in its ATP binding pocket and this has allowed the design of isoform selective covalent JAK3 inhibitors targeting this residue. We report here that mutating this cysteine to serine does not prevent JAK3 catalytic activity but does greatly increase the IC50 for covalent JAK3 inhibitors. Mice with a Cys905Ser knockin mutation in the endogenous JAK3 gene are viable and show no apparent welfare issues. Cells from these mice show normal STAT phosphorylation in response to JAK3 dependent cytokines but are resistant to the effects of covalent JAK3 inhibitors. These mice therefore provide a chemical-genetic model to study JAK3 function.",False,0,,True,0

Protostellar discs are mostly modelled as circular structures of gas and dust orbiting a protostar. However, a number of physical mechanisms, for example, the presence of a (sub)stellar companion or initial axial asymmetry, can cause the gas and dust orbital motion to become eccentric. Theoretical studies have revealed that, when present, disc eccentricity is expected to occur with predictable profiles that can be long-lasting and potentially observable in protostellar systems. Aims. We construct an analytical model predicting the typical features of the kinematics and morphology of eccentric protostellar discs, with the final goal of characterising the observational appearance of eccentricity in discs. Methods. We validate the model using a numerical simulation of a circumbinary disc (where the binary makes the disc eccentric). We finally post-process the simulation with Monte Carlo radiative transfer to study how eccentric features would appear through the ‘eyes’ of ALMA. Results. Besides the motion of the material on eccentric Keplerian orbits in the disc orbital plane, the most characteristic eccentric feature emerging from the analytical model is strong vertical motion with a typical anti-symmetric pattern (with respect to the disc line of pericentres). A circumbinary disc with a ≈ 40 au eccentric cavity ( e cav = 0.2), carved by an a bin = 15 au binary, placed at a distance d = 130 pc, is expected to host in its upper emission surface vertical oscillations up to v z ~ 400 m s −1 close to the cavity edge, that is to say, well within ALMA spectral and spatial resolution capabilities. A residual spiral pattern in the vertical velocity Δ v z ~ 150 m s −1 of the simulation cannot be captured by the theoretical model, we speculate it to be possibly linked to the presence of a companion in the system.",False,0,,True,0

In agreement with perturbative calculations, we observe that the radiation is minimal for small but finite velocities, rather than for collisions starting from rest.

As such, the need to constantly find and optimise suitable biocatalysts for specific transformations has never been greater. Metagenome mining has been shown to rapidly expand the toolkit of promiscuous enzymes needed for new transformations, without requiring protein engineering steps. If protein engineering is needed, the metagenomic candidate can often provide a better starting point for engineering than a previously discovered enzyme on the open database or from literature, for instance. In this review, we highlight where metagenomics has made substantial impact on the area of biocatalysis in recent years. We review the discovery of enzymes in previously unexplored or ‘hidden’ sequence space, leading to the characterisation of enzymes with enhanced properties that originate from natural selection pressures in native environments.",False,0,,True,0

One way of achieving this is to program a sequence of chemical reactions between precursor building blocks by means of attached oligonucleotide adapters. However, hydrolysis of the reactive building blocks has so far limited the length and yield of product that can be obtained using DNA‐templated reactions. Here, we report an architecture for DNA‐templated synthesis in which reactants are tethered at internal abasic sites on opposite strands of a DNA duplex. We show that an abasic site within a DNA duplex can protect a nearby thioester from degradation, significantly increasing the yield of a DNA‐templated reaction. This protective effect has the potential to overcome the challenges associated with programmable, sequence‐controlled synthesis of long non‐natural polymers by extending the lifetime of the reactive building blocks.",False,0,,True,0

The temporal evolution of the bed surfaces and the properties of the final beds were compared using metrics of surface grain size, microtopography, and bed organization at both grain and mesoscales. Measurements of the bed condition were obtained on nine occasions during each experiment to describe the temporal evolution of the beds. Structured mobile armors formed quickly in each experiment. At the grain scale (1–45 mm; 9 ≤ D s 50 ≤ 17 mm where D s 50 is the median surface particle size), surface complexity decreased and bed roughness increased in response to surface coarsening and the development of the mobile armor. Particles comprising the armor also became flow aligned and developed imbrication. At a larger scale (100–200 mm), the surface developed a mesoscale topography through the development of bed patches with lower and higher elevations. Metrics of mobile armor structure showed remarkable consistency over prolonged periods of near‐constant transport, demonstrating for the first time that actively transporting surfaces maintain an equilibrium bed structure. Bed structuring was least developed in the experiments conducted at the lowest flow strength. However, little difference was observed in the structural metrics of the mobile armors generated at higher flows. Although the range of transport rates studied was limited, the results suggest that the structure of mobile armors is insensitive to the formative transport rate except when rates are low ( τ * ≈ 0.03 where τ * is the dimensionless shear stress).",False,0,,True,0

Comparison with the archaeological and ethnographic records demonstrates the ubiquitous and enduring practices surrounding death, and the centrality of ritual specialists to this complex social and biological process. This deep-time perspective highlights the importance of nurses, and their associated nursing rituals, in the transition of patients between life and death, and the difficult journeys that nurse, patient and family undertake in this mediation between worlds. Such a perspective not only empowers nurses in their daily practices, and places nursing rituals firmly at the centre of modern palliative care work, but demonstrates the value of archaeology and ethnography in contextualising the challenges of today.",False,0,,True,0

Indeed, it reduces static power due to leakage current, and increases ST switch efficiency, making power gating more efficient and effective over time. The magnitude of these aging benefits depends on operating and environmental conditions. By means of HSPICE simulations, considering a 32-nm CMOS technology, we demonstrate that static power may reduce by more than 80% in 10 years of operation. Static power decrease over time due to NBTI aging is also proven experimentally, using a test chip manufactured with a 65-nm technology.

Whether these associations persist across life is unknown. Therefore, we investigated associations between developmental milestones and spine shape, as determined using statistical shape models (SSMs) of lumbar spine from dual‐energy X‐ray absorptiometry scans in 1327 individuals (688 female) at 60 to 64 years in the MRC National Survey of Health and Development. Lumbar lordosis angle (L4 inferior endplate to T12 superior endplate) was measured using the two‐line Cobb method. In analyses adjusted for sex, height, lean and fat mass, socioeconomic position, and birthweight, later walking age was associated with greater lordosis described by SSM1 (regression coefficient, 0.023; 95% CI, 0.000‐0.047; P = .05) and direct angle measurement. Modest associations between walking age and less variation in anterior‐posterior vertebral size caudally (SSM6) were also observed (0.021; 95% CI, −0.002 to 0.044; P = .07). Sex interactions showed that later walking was associated with larger relative vertebral anterior‐posterior dimensions in men (SSM3; −0.043; 95% CI, −0.075 to 0.01; P = .01) but not women (0.018; 95% CI, −0.0007 to 0.043; P = .17). Similar associations were observed between age at independent standing and SSMs but there was little evidence of association between sitting age and spine shape. Unadjusted associations between walking age and SSMs 1 and 6 remained similar after adjustment for potential confounders and mediators. This suggests that these associations may be explained by altered mechanical loading of the spine during childhood growth, although other factors could contribute. Early life motor development, particularly walking, may have a lasting effect on the features of spine morphology with clinical significance.",False,0,,True,0

However, the decomposition of eddy potential vorticity fluxes into rotational and divergent components is non-unique in a bounded domain and requires the imposition of an additional boundary condition. Here it is proposed to invoke a one-to-one correspondence between divergent eddy potential vorticity fluxes and non-divergent eddy momentum tendencies in the quasi-geostrophic residual-mean equations in order to select a unique divergent eddy potential vorticity flux. The divergent eddy potential vorticity flux satisfies a zero tangential component boundary condition. In a simply connected domain, the resulting divergent eddy potential vorticity flux satisfies a powerful optimality condition: it is the horizontally oriented divergent flux with minimum L2 norm. Hence there is a well-defined sense in which this approach removes as much of the dynamically inactive eddy potential vorticity flux as possible, and extracts an underlying dynamically active divergent eddy potential vorticity flux. It is shown that this approach leads to a divergent eddy potential vorticity flux which has an intuitive physical interpretation, via a direct relationship to the resulting forcing of the mean circulation.",False,0,,True,0

High-efficiency total absorption spectroscopy is an established and powerful tool for studying radiative capture reactions, particularly if combined with the cosmic background reduction by several orders of magnitude obtained at the Laboratory for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics (LUNA). We present recent improvements in the detection setup with the Bismuth Germanium Oxide (BGO) detector at LUNA, aiming to reduce high-energy backgrounds and increase the summing detection efficiency. The new design results in enhanced sensitivity of the BGO setup, as we demonstrate and discuss in the context of the first direct measurement of the 65 keV resonance ( E x = 5672 keV) of the 17 O(p, γ ) 18 F reaction. Moreover, we show two applications of the BGO detector, which exploit its segmentation. In the case of complex γ -ray cascades, e.g. the de-excitation of E x = 5672 keV in 18 F, the BGO segmentation allows to identify and suppress the beam-induced background signals that mimic the sum peak of interest. We demonstrate another new application for such a detector in form of in situ activation measurements of a reaction with β + unstable product nuclei, e.g. the 14 N(p, γ ) 15 O reaction.",False,0,,True,0

Predictions from simulation and theory for these interactions rely on a number of approximations and assumptions that have not been experimentally tested. Here, experimentally measurable signatures are identified that might be able to distinguish between radiation reaction models, i.e., classical or quantum, or between the local constant field and local monochromatic approximations used to calculate the properties of the nonlinear Compton process. These signatures are considered through Monte Carlo simulations of various experimental conditions that are relevant to today's laser facilities. Potential detection schemes for measuring the signatures are proposed. We find that single-photon counting of keV photons to resolve harmonics and scintillator-based detection of MeV photons may allow us to validate nonlinear Compton scattering models and radiation reaction models respectively.

The temperature inversion mechanism is a puzzle over 30 years old that has defied conventional explanations. One hypothesis is a unipolar inductor that achieves surface heating via ohmic dissipation of a current loop between a conducting planet and a magnetic white dwarf. To investigate this model, new time-resolved spectroscopy, spectropolarimetry, and photometry of the prototype GD 356 are studied. The emission features vary in strength on the rotational period, but in antiphase with the light curve, consistent with a cool surface spot beneath an optically thin chromosphere. Possible changes in the line profiles are observed at the same photometric phase, potentially suggesting modest evolution of the emission region, while the magnetic field varies by 10 per cent over a full rotation. These comprehensive data reveal neither changes to the photometric period, nor additional signals such as might be expected from an orbiting body. A closer examination of the unipolar inductor model finds points of potential failure: the observed rapid stellar rotation will inhibit current carriers due to the centrifugal force, there may be no supply of magnetospheric ions, and no antiphase flux changes are expected from ohmic surface heating. Together with the highly similar properties of the four cool, emission-line white dwarfs, these facts indicate that the chromospheric emission is intrinsic. A tantalizing possibility is that intrinsic chromospheres may manifest in (magnetic) white dwarfs, and in distinct parts of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram based on structure and composition.",False,0,,True,0

In one house the space heating was controlled conventionally (CC) according to minimum requirements in UK Building Regulation Part L1B for existing dwellings, whereas in the other house ZC was used to heat the rooms only when they were 'occupied'. Over an 8-week winter test period, the house with ZC used 11.8% less gas despite 2.4 percentage points drop in average daily boiler efficiency. Although zonal control reduced the mean indoor air temperature of the whole house by 0.6 °C, it did not reduce the average air temperature in rooms during the hours of active 'occupancy'. Normalisation and extrapolation of the results shows that, compared to CC, ZC could reduce annual gas demand for space heating by 12% in most regions of the UK, and that ZC would be a more effective energy efficiency measure in homes in the cooler, more northerly regions of the UK.",False,0,,True,0

High quantum yields require efficient electron transfer from the nanoparticle to the redox protein, a property that can be difficult to control. Here, we have compared binding and electron transfer between dye‐sensitized TiO 2 nanocrystals or CdS quantum dots and two decaheme cytochromes on photoanodes. The effect of NP surface chemistry was assessed by preparing NPs capped with amine or carboxylic acid functionalities. For the TiO 2 nanocrystals, binding to the cytochromes was optimal when capped with a carboxylic acid ligand, whereas for the CdS QDs, better adhesion was observed for amine capped ligand shells. When using TiO 2 nanocrystals, dye‐sensitized with a phosphonated bipyridine Ru(II) dye, photocurrents are observed that are dependent on the redox state of the decaheme, confirming that electrons are transferred from the TiO 2 nanocrystals to the surface via the decaheme conduit. In contrast, when CdS NPs are used, photocurrents are not dependent on the redox state of the decaheme, consistent with a model in which electron transfer from CdS to the photoanode bypasses the decaheme protein. These results illustrate that although the organic shell of NPs nanoparticles crucially affects coupling with proteinaceous material, the coupling can be difficult to predict or engineer.",False,0,,True,0

A new limiter concept has been proposed using lattice structures fabricated with tungsten powder by additive manufacturing techniques. The major potential benefits of using a lattice structure for limiters are the possibility to customise the thermal conductivity and structural compliance of these components to manage temperatures and stress within material limits and lower the sensitivity to crack propagation. This paper presents the results of the first investigations into the production, characterisation, and high heat flux testing of these lattices to assess their suitability for DEMO limiters. First stage prototypes have been manufactured from tungsten and tungsten tantalum mixed powder with two distinct laser power bed fusion processes, namely pulsed laser and continuous laser with heated bed. The samples are characterised in terms of mass, volume, density, extent of microcracks and voids, level of un-melted or partially melted particulates, texture and grain size, as well as tantalum segregation when applicable. High transient (0.25 ms) heat load testing, with hydrogen plasma of energy density up to ∼3 MJ m −2 was carried out at Kharkov Institute of Physics and Technology on the quasi-stationary plasma accellerator Kh-50. These tests have shown that the energy absorbed by latticed targets preheated at 500 °C is close to that absorbed by solid tungsten, suggesting that they may be used for limiter applications with the added advantage of adjustment of the heat transfer and stiffness performance by geometry design or material properties.",False,0,,True,0

The model proposed represents each Lidar waveform as a combination of a known impulse response, weighted by the target intensity, and an unknown constant background, corrupted by Poisson noise. Prior knowledge about the problem is embedded in a hierarchical model that describes the dependence structure between the model parameters and their constraints. In particular, a gamma Markov random field (MRF) is used to model the joint distribution of the target intensity, and a second MRF is used to model the distribution of the target depth, which are both expected to exhibit significant spatial correlations. An adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is then proposed to compute the Bayesian estimates of interest and perform Bayesian inference. This algorithm is equipped with a stochastic optimization adaptation mechanism that automatically adjusts the parameters of the MRFs by maximum marginal likelihood estimation. Finally, the benefits of the proposed methodology are demonstrated through a serie of experiments using real data.",False,0,,True,0

Traditionally the difficulty in obtaining accurate non-destructive interfacial measurements has hindered systematic experimental investigations. Recently, an ultrasound reflectometry technique has been developed as a direct observation method of a rolling-sliding interface; however, the topography dependence under the high contact pressures in a wheel-rail contact has not been clarified. For this reason, a novel in situ measurement of the contact stiffness using ultrasound reflectometry was carried out for three different levels of roughness. A contact pressure equivalent to that in a wheel-rail interface was achieved by using a high-pressure torsion test approach. The dynamic change of contact stiffness with slip was measured using ultrasound and the influence of roughness was investigated. The measured changes were validated using a newly developed numerical simulation, and mechanisms to explain the observed behaviour were proposed in terms of fracture and plastic deformation of the asperity bonds. These findings could help in understanding the traction characteristics for different roughness conditions and also assist in understanding damage mechanisms better, such as wear and rolling contact fatigue.",False,0,,True,0

Such quantities provide insight into population trends over time and the associated underlying ecological drivers of the systems. This information is fundamental in managing ecosystems, assessing species conservation status and developing and implementing effective conservation policy. Observational monitoring data are typically collected on wildlife populations using an array of different survey protocols, dependent on the primary questions of interest. For each of these survey designs, a range of advanced statistical techniques have been developed which are typically well understood. However, often multiple types of data may exist for the same population under study. Analyzing each data set separately implicitly discards the common information contained in the other data sets. An alternative approach that aims to optimize the shared information contained within multiple data sets is to use a “model-based data integration” approach, or more commonly referred to as an “integrated model.” This integrated modeling approach simultaneously analyzes all the available data within a single, and robust, statistical framework. This paper provides a statistical overview of ecological integrated models, with a focus on integrated population models (IPMs) which include abundance and demographic rates as quantities of interest. Four main challenges within this area are discussed, namely model specification, computational aspects, model assessment and forecasting. This should encourage researchers to explore further and develop new practical tools to ensure that full utility can be made of IPMs for future studies.",False,0,,True,0

Starting with H 2 and CO 2 , the synthesis of amino acids and mixed fatty acids, which self-assemble into protocells, is favoured under warm anoxic conditions. Here, we address whether it is possible for protocells to evolve greater metabolic complexity, through positive feedbacks involving nucleotide catalysis. Using mathematical simulations to model metabolic heredity in protocells, based on branch points in protometabolic flux, we show that nucleotide catalysis can indeed promote protocell growth. This outcome only occurs when nucleotides directly catalyse CO 2 fixation. Strong nucleotide catalysis of other pathways (e.g. fatty acids and amino acids) generally unbalances metabolism and slows down protocell growth, and when there is competition between catalytic functions cell growth collapses. Autocatalysis of nucleotide synthesis can promote growth but only if nucleotides also catalyse CO 2 fixation; autocatalysis alone leads to the accumulation of nucleotides at the expense of CO 2 fixation and protocell growth rate.

Using short-course antibiotics to treat VAP caused by Gram-negative non-fermenting bacteria has been reported to be associated with excess pneumonia recurrences. The “REducinG Antibiotic tReatment Duration for Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia” (REGARD-VAP) trial aims to provide evidence for using a set of reproducible clinical criteria to shorten antibiotic duration for individualised treatment duration of VAP. Methods and analysis This is a randomised controlled hierarchical non-inferiority–superiority trial being conducted in ICUs across Nepal, Thailand and Singapore. The primary outcome is a composite endpoint of death and pneumonia recurrence at day 60. Secondary outcomes include ventilator-associated events, multidrug-resistant organism infection or colonisation, total duration of antibiotic exposure, mechanical ventilation and hospitalisation. Adult patients who satisfy the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network VAP diagnostic criteria are enrolled. Participants are assessed daily until fever subsides for &gt;48 hours and have stable blood pressure, then randomised to a short duration treatment strategy or a standard-of-care duration arm. Antibiotics may be stopped as early as day 3 if respiratory cultures are negative, and day 5 if respiratory cultures are positive in the short-course arm. Participants receiving standard-of-care will receive antibiotics for at least 8 days. Study participants are followed for 60 days after enrolment. An estimated 460 patients will be required to achieve 80% power to determine non-inferiority with a margin of 12%. All outcomes are compared by absolute risk differences. The conclusion of non-inferiority, and subsequently superiority, will be based on unadjusted and adjusted analyses in both the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations.

Typically, a rectangular bounding box containing a single object is provided in the first (few) frame(s) and then the method tracks the object in the rest frames. However, for deformable objects (e.g. faces, bodies) the single bounding box scenario is sub-optimal; a part-based approach would be more effective. The current state-of-the-art part-based approach is incrementally trained discriminative Deformable Part Models (DPM). Nevertheless, training discriminative DPMs with one or a few examples poses a huge challenge. We argue that a generative model is a better fit for the task. We utilise the powerful pictorial structures, which we augment with incremental updates to account for object adaptations. Our proposed incremental pictorial structures, which we call IPST, are experimentally validated in different scenarios. In a thorough experimentation we demonstrate that IPST outperforms the existing model-free methods in facial landmark tracking, body tracking, animal tracking (newly introduced to verify the strength in ad hoc cases).",False,0,,True,0

One guaranteed anisotropic signal is the kinematic dipole induced by our peculiar motion with respect to the cosmic rest frame, as measured in other full-sky observables such as the cosmic microwave background. Our prior knowledge of the amplitude and direction of this dipole is not explicitly accounted for in existing searches by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA but could provide crucial information to help disentangle the sources which contribute to the gravitational-wave background. Here, we develop a targeted search pipeline which uses this prior knowledge to enable unbiased and minimum-variance inference of the dipole magnitude. Our search generalizes existing methods to allow for a time-dependent signal model, which captures the annual modulation of the dipole due to the Earth's orbit. We validate our pipeline on mock data, demonstrating that neglecting this time dependence can bias the inferred dipole by as much as $\mathcal{O}(10%)$. We then run our analysis on the full LIGO/Virgo $\mathrm{O}1+\mathrm{O}2+\mathrm{O}3$ dataset, obtaining upper limits on the dipole amplitude that are consistent with existing anisotropic search results.",False,0,,True,0

By screening a P. aeruginosa transposon library to identify factors required for DNA release, mutants with insertions in the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway were identified as exhibiting reduced eDNA release, and defective biofilm architecture with enhanced susceptibility to tobramycin. P. aeruginosa tat mutants showed substantial reductions in pyocyanin, rhamnolipid and membrane vesicle (MV) production consistent with perturbation of PQS-dependent QS as demonstrated by changes in pqsA expression and 2-alkyl-4-quinolone (AQ) production. Provision of exogenous PQS to the tat mutants did not return pqsA, rhlA or phzA1 expression or pyocyanin production to wild type levels. However, transformation of the tat mutants with the AQ-independent pqs effector pqsE restored phzA1 expression and pyocyanin production. Since mutation or inhibition of Tat prevented PQS-driven auto-induction, we sought to identify the Tat substrate(s) responsible. A pqsA::lux fusion was introduced into each of 34 validated P. aeruginosa Tat substrate deletion mutants. Analysis of each mutant for reduced bioluminescence revealed that the primary signalling defect was associated with the Rieske iron-sulfur subunit of the cytochrome bc1 complex. In common with the parent strain, a Rieske mutant exhibited defective PQS signalling, AQ production, rhlA expression and eDNA release that could be restored by genetic complementation. This defect was also phenocopied by deletion of cytB or cytC1. Thus, either lack of the Rieske sub-unit or mutation of cytochrome bc1 genes results in the perturbation of PQS-dependent autoinduction resulting in eDNA deficient biofilms, reduced antibiotic tolerance and compromised virulence factor production.",False,0,,True,0

In particular, it has implications on the half‐life, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetics of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and must be closely monitored throughout drug development and manufacturing. To address this, advances have been made primarily in upstream processing, including mammalian cell line engineering, to yield more predictably glycosylated mAbs and the addition of media supplements during fermentation to manipulate the metabolic pathways involved in glycosylation. A more robust approach would be a conjoined upstream–downstream processing strategy. This could include implementing novel downstream technologies, such as the use of Fc γ‐based affinity ligands for the separation of mAb glycovariants. This review highlights the importance of controlling therapeutic antibody glycosylation patterns, the challenges faced in terms of glycosylation during mAb biosimilar development, current efforts both upstream and downstream to control glycosylation and their limitations, and the need for research in the downstream space to establish holistic and consistent manufacturing processes for the production of antibody therapies.",False,0,,True,0

We find the average deviation in MWA from the MWA-$M_\star$ relation depends on position in PPS, with a maximum difference between the inner cluster and infalling interloper galaxies of $\sim 1$ Gyr. Our model employs infall information from N-body simulations and stochastic star-formation histories from the UniverseMachine model. We find total quenching times of $t_\mathrm{Q}=3.7\pm 0.4$ Gyr and $t_\mathrm{Q}=4.0\pm 0.2$ Gyr after first pericentre, for $9<\log(M_{\star}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})<10$ and $10<\log(M_{\star}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})<10.5$ galaxies, respectively. By using MWAs, we break the degeneracy in time of quenching onset and timescale of star formation rate (SFR) decline. We find that time of quenching onset relative to pericentre is $t_{\mathrm{delay}}=3.5^{+0.6}_{-0.9}$ Gyr and $t_{\mathrm{delay}}=-0.3^{+0.8}_{-1.0}$ Gyr for our lower and higher stellar mass bins, respectively, and exponential SFR suppression timescales are $\tau_{\mathrm{env}}\leq 1.0$ Gyr and $\tau_{\mathrm{env}}\sim 2.3$ Gyr for our lower and higher stellar mass bins, respectively. Stochastic star formation histories remove the need for rapid infall quenching to maintain the bimodality in the SFR of cluster galaxies; the depth of the green valley prefers quenching onsets close to first pericentre and a longer quenching envelope, in slight tension with the MWA-driven results. Taken together these results suggest that quenching begins close to, or just after pericentre, but the timescale for quenching to be fully complete is much longer and therefore ram-pressure stripping is not complete on first pericentric passage.",False,0,,True,0

In a few systems, dips have been observed. The mechanism behind this state transition and the dips nature are still debated. To investigate these issues, we obtained a long XMM–Newton monitoring campaign of a member of this class, NGC 247 ULX-1. We computed the hardness–intensity diagram for the whole data set and identified two different branches: the normal branch and the dipping branch, which we study with four and three hardness–intensity resolved spectra, respectively. All seven spectra are well described by two thermal components: a colder (kTbb ∼ 0.1–0.2 keV) blackbody, interpreted as emission from the photosphere of a radiatively driven wind, and a hotter (kTdisc ∼ 0.6 keV) multicolour disc blackbody, likely due to reprocessing of radiation emitted from the innermost regions. In addition, a complex pattern of emission and absorption lines has been taken into account based on previous high-resolution spectroscopic results. We studied the evolution of spectral parameters and flux of the two thermal components along the two branches and discuss two scenarios possibly connecting the state transition and the dipping phenomenon. One is based on geometrical occultation of the emitting regions, the other invokes the onset of a propeller effect.",False,0,,True,0

This paper develops a deep learning approach to infer a passenger's employment status by using smart card data (SCD) with a household survey. This paper first extracts an individual passenger's weekly travel patterns in different travel modes from the raw SCD as a three-dimensional image. A deep learning architecture, called a thresholding multi-channel convolutional neural network, was developed to predict an individual's employment status. The approach proposed here solves two critical problems of using the SCD for employment status studies. First, it automatically incorporates learning temporal features in different travel modes without the need for handcrafted travel feature design. Second, it considers the class-imbalance problem by leveraging the ensemble of oversampling and thresholding techniques. By applying our approach to a real dataset collected from the metropolitan area of London, U.K., about 72% of passengers were correctly categorized into six types of employment statuses. The promising results show the tight correlation between temporal travel behavior, mode choice, and social-demographic roles.

For β-lactamases, the ability to make such predictions would contribute to understanding activity against, and development of, antibiotics and inhibitors to combat resistance. Here, using dynamical non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (D-NEMD) simulations combined with experiments, we demonstrate that intramolecular communication networks differ in three class A SulpHydryl Variant (SHV)-type β-lactamases.

Herein, we report the ultralow loading of Au nanoparticles onto MoS2 electrodes by the spontaneous process of galvanic deposition. AuNP@MoS2 electrode synthesis was optimized, and electrodes containing the smallest Au nanoparticle diameter (2.9 nm) and the lowest Au loading (0.044 μg cm–2) exhibited the best overall and intrinsic electrocatalytic performance. This enhancement is attributed to an increased Au–MoS2 interaction with smaller nanoparticles, making the MoS2 electrode more n-type. DC electrochemical characterization for the AuNP@MoS2 electrodes showed an exchange current density of 7.28 μA cm–2 and an overpotential at 10 mA cm–2 of −323 mV. These values are 4.5 times higher and 100 mV lower than those of the unmodified MoS2 electrode, respectively. Electrochemical AC experiments were used to evaluate the electrodes' intrinsic catalytic activity, and it was shown that the AuNP@MoS2 electrodes exhibited an enhanced activity by as much as 3.5 times compared with MoS2.

Aggregators monitor the state of the building and communicate with the energy system to adjust the building’s demand while maintaining comfort levels, in return for suitable payments. Energy service companies may sell energy-as-a-service and own the equipment instead of a consumer who wishes to minimize their upfront costs, and the idea of an active, energy-efficient, building may be attractive to the tenants of the new group of all-inclusive rental companies, and hence to those companies.

We study here the ETG NGC 524, with strong shear suspected to result in a smooth molecular gas disc and low star-formation efficiency (SFE). We present new spatially resolved observations of the 12CO(2-1)-emitting cold molecular gas from the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) and of the warm ionized-gas emission lines from SITELLE at the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope. Although constrained by the resolution of the ALMA observations (≈37 pc), we identify only 52 GMCs with radii ranging from 30 to 140 pc, a low mean molecular gas mass surface density ⟨Σgas⟩ ≈ 125 M⊙ pc−2 and a high mean virial parameter ⟨αobs, vir⟩ ≈ 5.3. We measure spatially resolved molecular gas depletion times (τdep ≡ 1/SFE) with a spatial resolution of ≈100 pc within a galactocentric distance of 1.5 kpc. The global depletion time is ≈2.0 Gyr but τdep increases towards the galaxy centre, with a maximum τdep, max ≈ 5.2 Gyr. However, no pure H ii region is identified in NGC 524 using ionized-gas emission-line ratio diagnostics, so the τdep inferred are in fact lower limits.

Specifically, in a fly photoreceptor, this limit is set by the number of its photon sampling units (microvilli), constituting its light sensor (the rhabdomere), and the speed and recoverability of their phototransduction reactions. In this review, using an insightful constructionist viewpoint of a fly photoreceptor being an ‘imperfect’ photon counting machine, we explain how these constraints give rise to adaptive quantal information sampling in time, which maximises information in responses to salient light changes while antialiasing visual signals. Interestingly, such sampling innately determines also why photoreceptors extract more information, and more economically, from naturalistic light contrast changes than Gaussian white‐noise stimuli, and we explicate why this is so. Our main message is that stochasticity in quantal information sampling is less noise and more processing, representing an ‘evolutionary adaptation’ to generate a reliable neural estimate of the variable world. image",False,0,,True,0

Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is the most common because of its foaming properties, taste and low cost. However, the use of ionic surfactants, especially SDS, is related to several oral mucosa conditions. Thus, there is a high interest in using non-ionic and amphoteric surfactants as they are less irritant. To better understand the performance of these surfactants in oral care products, we investigated their interaction with salivary pellicles i.e., the proteinaceous films that cover surfaces exposed to saliva. Specifically, we focused on pentaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C 12 E 5 ) and cocamidopropyl betaine (CAPB) as model nonionic and amphoteric surfactants respectively, and investigated their interaction with reconstituted salivary pellicles with various surface techniques: Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation, Ellipsometry, Force Spectroscopy and Neutron Reflectometry. Both C 12 E 5 and CAPB were gentler on pellicles than SDS, removing a lower amount. However, their interaction with pellicles differed. Our work indicates that CAPB would mainly interact with the mucin components of pellicles, leading to collapse and dehydration. In contrast, exposure to C 12 E 5 had a minimal effect on the pellicles, mainly resulting in the replacement/solubilisation of some of the components anchoring pellicles to their substrate.",False,0,,True,0

Here we describe efficient routes starting from validated parallel and antiparallel peptide assemblies to design two families of α-helical barrel proteins with central channels that bind small molecules. Computational designs are seeded by the sequences and structures of defined de novo oligomeric barrel-forming peptides, and adjacent helices are connected by loop building. For targets with antiparallel helices, short loops are sufficient. However, targets with parallel helices require longer connectors; namely, an outer layer of helix–turn–helix–turn–helix motifs that are packed onto the barrels. Throughout these computational pipelines, residues that define open states of the barrels are maintained. This minimizes sequence sampling, accelerating the design process. For each of six targets, just two to six synthetic genes are made for expression in Escherichia coli . On average, 70% of these genes express to give soluble monomeric proteins that are fully characterized, including high-resolution structures for most targets that match the design models with high accuracy.",False,0,,True,0

One such protein is AKAP5 (previously AKAP79), which contains SLiMs that anchor PKA and Calcineurin, and recruit substrate (the TRPV1 receptor). Calcineurin is anchored to AKAP5 by a well-characterised PxIxIT SLiM. Here we show, using a combination of biochemical and biophysical approaches, that the Calcineurin PxIxIT-binding groove also recognises several hitherto unknown lower-affinity SLiMs in addition to the PxIxIT motif. We demonstrate that the assembly is in reality a complex system with conserved SLiMs spanning a wide affinity range. The capture is analogous to that seen for many DNA-binding proteins that have a weak non-specific affinity for DNA outside the canonical binding site, but different in that it involves (i) two proteins, and (ii) hydrophobic rather than electrostatic interactions. It is also compatible with the requirement for both stable anchoring of the enzyme and responsive downstream signalling. We conclude that the AKAP5 C-terminus is enriched in lower-affinity/mini-SLiMs that, together with the canonical SLiM, maintain a structurally disordered but tightly regulated signalosome.",False,0,,True,0

Existing computational algorithms for LQNs have primarily focused on mean-value analysis. However, other solution paradigms, such as normalizing constant analysis and mean-field approximation, can improve the computation of LQN mean and transient performance metrics, state probabilities, and response time distributions. Motivated by this observation, we propose the first LQN meta-solver, called LN, that allows for the dynamic selection of the performance analysis paradigm to be iteratively applied to the submodels arising from layer decomposition. We report experiments where this added flexibility helps us to reduce the LQN solution errors. We also demonstrate that the meta-solver approach eases the integration of LQNs with other formalisms, such as caching models, enabling the analysis of more general classes of layered stochastic networks. Additionally, to support the accurate evaluation of the LQN submodels, we develop novel algorithms for homogeneous queueing networks consisting of an infinite server node and a set of identical queueing stations. In particular, we propose an exact method of moment algorithms, integration techniques for normalizing constants, and a fast non-iterative mean-value analysis technique.",False,0,,True,1

Within this approximation, certain eigenstates of the system are shown to be multicomponent wave functions that connect smoothly to the Landau levels of the continuum. The perturbative corrections to these are higher Landau level contributions that break rotational invariance and allow the perturbed states to adopt the symmetry of the lattice. In the presence of interactions, this approach allows for the calculation of generalized Haldane pseudopotentials, and in turn, the many-body properties of the system.

Anthropogenic aerosols are dominant drivers of historical monsoon rainfall change. However, large uncertainties in the radiative forcing associated with anthropogenic aerosol emissions, as well as the dynamical response to this forcing, lead to uncertainty in the simulated monsoon response. We use historical simulations from the “SMURPHS” project, run using HadGEM3-GC3.1, in which the time-varying aerosol emissions are scaled by factors from 0.2 to 1.5 to explore the monsoon sensitivity to historical aerosol forcing uncertainty (present-day versus preindustrial aerosol forcing in the range −0.38 to −1.50 W m−2). The hemispheric asymmetry in emissions generates a strong relationship between scaling factor and both hemispheric temperature contrast and meridional location of tropical rainfall. Averaged over the period 1950–2014, increasing the scaling factor from 0.2 to 1.5 reduces the hemispheric temperature contrast by 0.9 ∘C, reduces the tropical summertime land–sea temperature contrast by 0.3 ∘C and shifts tropical rainfall southwards by 0.28∘ of latitude. The result is a reduction in global monsoon area by 3 % and a reduction in global monsoon intensity by 2 %. Despite the complexity of the monsoon system, the monsoon properties presented above vary monotonically and roughly linearly across scalings. A switch in the dominant influence on the 1950–1980 monsoon rainfall trend between greenhouse gases and aerosol is identified as the scalings increase. Regionally, aerosol scaling has a pronounced effect on Northern Hemisphere monsoon rainfall, with the strongest influence on monsoon area and intensity located in the Asian sector, where local emissions are greatest.",False,0,,True,0

This recognizes that, traditionally, the environmental science community has mostly seen stakeholder engagement as a ‘follow on’ activity to be undertaken once the key scientific research has been completed. By excluding communities from the scientific process, or at best approaching communities in one-way communication, scientists are missing out on the wealth of local community knowledge about the very facets of the environment which they seek to understand. The challenge, however, is in identifying, developing and adopting appropriate platforms for communication and co-creation to allow scientists and local communities to have effective dialogue, efficiently gather, interpret and evaluate lay knowledge, and develop relevant, scientifically robust, but widely comprehensible, results. DRY (Drought Risk and You) was a 4-year project, funded under the RCUK Drought and Water Scarcity Program, with the aim of developing an evidence-based resource to support better decision-making in United Kingdom drought risk management. In DRY, scientific data and multiple narrative approaches have been brought together to facilitate decision-making processes and improve community resilience. Creative experiments were designed by the DRY interdisciplinary team to engage local communities in using specialist science as a stimulus for storytelling at catchment level, but also to give scientists the insight required to develop meaningful scenarios of local change to explore potential drought impacts in a particular river catchment. One challenge of working with storytelling is that it is very often retrospective and linked to past experiences and memories. It can be seen as a backward-looking activity, learning principally from what has happened before. The participatory approaches applied in DRY demonstrated that storytelling can be also used to imagine, interrogate and plan for a future that communities might collectively wish to subscribe or adapt to. In particular, by co-designing and facilitating storyboarding workshops, the DRY team, together with local stakeholders, have been exploring the ‘scenario-ing’ of possible futures as a way of creating a story and visualizing a picture for the future of the community. By allowing the scientists, community and local stakeholders to develop model drought scenarios iteratively together using storytelling, these scenarios should not only be scientifically accurate, but should also reflect local interests and aspirations, as well as local drought mitigation practices. This process integrates valuable knowledge exchange and the building of mutual capital to support local risk decision-making - scaling up from the level of the individual to the collective.",False,0,,True,0

The general distribution of variants is shown to reflect educational differences amongst our speakers.

Concerns include animal collision with turbine blades, disruption of migratory and foraging behaviour, attraction of animals to prey aggregating around turbines, or conversely displacement of animals from preferred habitat. This study used concurrent ecological and physical measurements to show the predictability of fish school characteristics (presence, school area and height above seabed) in a high energy tidal site across spring/neap, ebb/flood and daily cycles, and how this changed around a turbine structure. The rate of schools and school area per hour increased by 1.74 and 1.75 times respectively around a turbine structure compared to observations under similar conditions without a turbine structure. The largest schools occurred at peak flow speeds and the vertical distribution of schools over the diel cycle was altered around the turbine structure. While predictable attraction or aggregation of prey may increase prey availability and predator foraging efficiency, attraction of predators has the potential to increase animal collision risk. Predictable changes from the installation of turbine structures can be used to estimate cumulative effects on predators at a population level.

Here, we report that Emb-LPD and sustained LPD reduce neural stem cells (NSCs) in the fetal brain. Moreover, Emb-LPD causes remaining NSCs to upregulate neuronal differentiation in compensation beyond control levels and increase cortex thickness and neuron ratio, leading to adult memory deficits.

We used the Reference Station Technique to overcome potential contamination from the source-side anisotropy on the direct S wave signals. This method enabled us to expand our splitting measurement database beyond the usual SK(K)S phases. The average splitting delay time over the entire region was found to be 1.14 ± 0.42 s for the SK(K)S wave and 1.36 ± 0.26 s for the direct S wave. In most parts of the study area, the fast polarization directions for both shear phases are consistent and show a uniform NE–SW direction with an average of 36° and 37° for SK(K)S and S wave-derived results, respectively. This direction is in close agreement with the direction of the absolute plate motion vector in NW Iran (N39°E). The fast directions are associated with neither the surface geological trends, nor the geodetic strain fields. We propose that the observed anisotropy is mainly controlled by the LPO fabric developed due to the shearing of the asthenospheric layer in response to the motion of the lithosphere relative to the deeper mantle. Only in a narrow region near the tectonic boundaries of central Iran with NW Iran and the Alborz, NW–SE oriented SK(K)S fast directions tend to align with the major geological structures. Fast directions obtained from direct S wave indicate significantly smoother variations in the same regions and mostly continue to be aligned in the NE–SW direction. We attribute these differences to the change in the structure of the lithosphere in the tectonic boundary zone. The western margins of central Iran possess a strong deformational fabric as evidenced by the major active strike-slip zones there. Considering that the depth extent of this fabric expands over a relatively narrow zone in the mantle, it can locally influence the SK(K)S phases. The direct S waves, on the other hand, have a larger footprint and therefore average over a larger region, and relative to the SK(K)S phases, are influenced more strongly by the asthenospheric fabric due to their larger angles of incidence, which results in a larger zone of influence for station average anisotropy parameters.",False,0,,True,0

Hence, signed networks, where each connection can be either positive or negative, have become popular models over recent years. However, the primary focus of the literature is on the unweighted and structurally balanced ones, where all cycles have an even number of negative edges. Hence here, we first introduce a classification of signed networks into balanced, antibalanced, or strictly unbalanced ones, and then characterize each type of signed networks in terms of the spectral properties of the signed weighted adjacency matrix. In particular, we show that the spectral radius of the matrix with signs is smaller than that without if and only if the signed network is strictly unbalanced. These properties are important to understand the dynamics on signed networks, both linear and nonlinear ones. Specifically, we find consistent patterns in a linear and a nonlinear dynamics theoretically, depending on their type of balance. We also propose two measures to further characterize strictly unbalanced networks, motivated by perturbation theory. Finally, we numerically verify these properties through experiments on both synthetic and real networks.Keywordssigned networksstructural balance and antibalanceweighted adjacency matrixlinear and nonlinear dynamicsrandom walksMSC codes05C2205C5005C8137E2539A0691D3094C15",False,0,,True,0

Large population-based descriptive studies of PA, incorporating precise measurement, are needed to understand the relative burden of insufficient PA levels and to inform the tailoring of interventions. Combined heart and movement sensing enables the study of physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) and intensity distribution. We aimed to describe the sociodemographic correlates of PAEE and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in UK adults. Methods The Fenland study is a population-based cohort study of 12,435 adults aged 29–64 years-old in Cambridgeshire, UK. Following individual calibration (treadmill), participants wore a combined heart rate and movement sensor continuously for 6 days in free-living, from which we derived PAEE (kJ•day − 1 •kg − 1 ) and time in MVPA (&gt; 3 &amp; &gt; 4 METs) in bouts greater than 1 min and 10 min. Socio-demographic information was self-reported. Stratum-specific summary statistics and multivariable analyses were performed. Results Women accumulated a mean (sd) 50(20) kJ•day − 1 •kg − 1 of PAEE, and 83(67) and 33(39) minutes•day − 1 of 1-min bouted and 10-min bouted MVPA respectively. By contrast, men recorded 59(23) kJ•day − 1 •kg − 1 , 124(84) and 60(58) minutes•day − 1 . Age and BMI were also important correlates of PA. Association with age was inverse in both sexes, more strongly so for PAEE than MVPA. Obese individuals accumulated less PA than their normal-weight counterparts, whether considering PAEE or allometrically-scaled PAEE (− 10 kJ•day − 1 •kg − 1 or − 15 kJ•day − 1 •kg -2/3 in men). Higher income and manual work were associated with higher PA; manual workers recorded 13–16 kJ•kg − 1 •day − 1 more PAEE than sedentary counterparts. Overall, 86% of women and 96% of men accumulated a daily average of MVPA (&gt; 3 METs) corresponding to 150 min per week. These values were 49 and 74% if only considering bouts &gt; 10 min (15 and 31% for &gt; 4 METs). Conclusions PA varied by age, sex and BMI, and was higher in manual workers and those with higher incomes. Light physical activity was the main driver of PAEE; a component of PA that is currently not quantified as a target in UK guidelines.",False,0,,True,0

Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy of both types of particles revealed considerable differences in CLP structure compared to the crystal structure of infection-derived CLPs; in contrast, the two recombinant CLPs have an identical external structure. Using this insight, we exploited the unencumbered pore at the 5-fold axis of symmetry and the absence of encapsidated RNA to label the interior of empty CLPs with a fluorescent bioconjugate. CLPs containing 120 GFP molecules and those containing approximately 150 dye molecules were both shown to bind human integrin via a naturally occurring Arg-Gly-Asp motif found on an exposed loop of the VP7 trimeric spike. Furthermore, fluorescently labeled CLPs were shown to interact with a cell line overexpressing the surface receptor. Thus, BTV CLPs present themselves as a useful tool in targeted cargo delivery.

While it is well known that star clusters form within parsec-scale overdensities of interstellar molecular gas called clumps, it is, however, unclear whether these clumps represent the high-density tip of a continuous gaseous flow that gradually leads towards the formation of stars, or a transition within the gas physical properties. Here, we present a unique analysis of a sample of 27 infrared dark clouds embedded within 24 individual molecular clouds that combine a large set of observations, allowing us to compute the mass and velocity dispersion profiles of each, from the scale of tens of parsecs down to the scale of tenths of a parsec. These profiles reveal that the vast majority of the clouds, if not all, are consistent with being self-gravitating on all scales, and that the clumps, on parsec-scale, are often dynamically decoupled from their surrounding molecular clouds, exhibiting steeper density profiles (ρ∝r−2) and flat velocity dispersion profiles (σ∝r0), clearly departing from Larson’s relations. These findings suggest that the formation of star clusters correspond to a transition regime within the properties of the self-gravitating molecular gas. We propose that this transition regime is one that corresponds to the gravitational collapse of parsec-scale clumps within otherwise stable molecular clouds.",False,0,,True,0

Nucleic acids can act as critical modulators in the stability of these protein condensates. To unveil the role of RNA length in regulating the stability of RNA binding protein (RBP) condensates, we present a multiscale computational strategy that exploits the advantages of a sequence-dependent coarse-grained representation of proteins and a minimal coarse-grained model wherein proteins are described as patchy colloids. We find that for a constant nucleotide/protein ratio, the protein fused in sarcoma (FUS), which can phase separate on its own-i.e., via homotypic interactions-only exhibits a mild dependency on the RNA strand length. In contrast, the 25-repeat proline-arginine peptide (PR25), which does not undergo LLPS on its own at physiological conditions but instead exhibits complex coacervation with RNA-i.e., via heterotypic interactions-shows a strong dependence on the length of the RNA strands. Our minimal patchy particle simulations suggest that the strikingly different effect of RNA length on homotypic LLPS versus RBP-RNA complex coacervation is general. Phase separation is RNA-length dependent whenever the relative contribution of heterotypic interactions sustaining LLPS is comparable or higher than those stemming from protein homotypic interactions. Taken together, our results contribute to illuminate the intricate physicochemical mechanisms that influence the stability of RBP condensates through RNA inclusion.",False,0,,True,0

Both the geometry and physical fields are discretized using Catmull–Clark subdivision bases. This provides the required ‐continuous discretization for the Kirchhoff–Love theory. The crystalline structure of piezoelectric materials is described using an anisotropic constitutive relation. Hamilton's variational principle is applied to the dynamic analysis to derive the weak form of the governing equations. The coupled eigenvalue problem is formulated by considering the problem of harmonic vibration in the absence of external load. The formulation for the purely elastic case is verified using a spherical thin shell benchmark. Thereafter, the piezoelectric shell formulation is verified using a one dimensional piezoelectric beam.

Consequently, chloride homeostasis is ideally placed to regulate activity. We therefore investigated the stability of baseline [Cl - ] i in adult mouse neocortex, using in vivo two-photon imaging. We found a two-fold increase in baseline [Cl - ] i in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, from day to night, with marked effects upon both physiological cortical processing and seizure susceptibility. Importantly, the night-time activity can be converted to the day-time pattern by local inhibition of NKCC1, while inhibition of KCC2 converts day-time [Cl - ] i towards night-time levels. Changes in the surface expression and phosphorylation of the cation-chloride cotransporters, NKCC1 and KCC2, matched these pharmacological effects. When we extended the dark period by 4 h, mice remained active, but [Cl - ] i was modulated as for animals in normal light cycles. Our data thus demonstrate a daily [Cl - ] i modulation with complex effects on cortical excitability.",False,0,,True,0

A strong evidence base is needed to support innovative service development and a 3-year research programme is being undertaken to capture best evidence of wellbeing impacts and outcomes of cultural and sporting activities in order to inform UK policy and practice. This article provides an overview of methods and findings from an initial coproduction process with key stakeholders that sought to explore and agree principles and parameters of the evidence review for culture, sport and wellbeing (CSW). Methods: A two-stage DELPHI process was conducted with a purposeful sample of 57 stakeholders between August and December 2015. Participants were drawn from a range of culture and sport organisations and included commissioners and managers, policy makers, representatives of service delivery organisations (SDOs) and scholars. The DELPHI 1 questionnaire was developed from extensive consultation in July and August 2015. It explored definitions of wellbeing, the role of evidence, quality assessment, and the culture and sport populations, settings and interventions that are most likely to deliver wellbeing outcomes. Following further consultation, the results, presented as a series of ranked statements, were sent back to participants (DELPHI 2), which allowed them to reflect on and, if they wished, express agreement or disagreement with the emerging consensus. Results: A total of 40 stakeholders (70.02%) responded to the DELPHI questionnaires. DELPHI 1 mapped areas of agreement and disagreement, confirmed in DELPHI 2. The exercise drew together the key priorities for the CSW evidence review. Conclusion: The DELPHI process, in combination with face-to-face deliberation, enabled stakeholders to engage in complex discussion and express nuanced priorities while also allowing the group to come to an overall consensus and agree outcomes. The results will inform the CSW evidence review programme until its completion in March 2018.",False,0,,True,1

Renewed excavation is shedding new light on its occupational chronology and socioeconomic history, including activities such as burial, savanna herding, and domesticated sorghum cultivation practices dating to at least the mid-third millennium BC. In the present study, predominantly final phase pottery sherds from the first millennium BC to the start of the first millennium AD (Assemblage 3) have been analyzed via a combination of thin section petrography and instrumental geochemistry to determine their raw materials and place of manufacture and reconstruct their manufacturing technology. Organic residue analysis was also conducted to identify the products processed within vessels found at the site. The results suggest the existence of a well-developed local ceramic craft tradition that persisted for over one thousand years. Pots from Assemblage 3 were used to process, store, and consume animal and plant products, thus reinforcing emerging evidence for early agro-pastoral activities.",False,0,,True,0

Wetland emissions contribute the largest uncertainties to the current global atmospheric CH4 budget, and how these emissions will change under future climate scenarios is also still poorly understood. Bloom et al. (2017b) developed WetCHARTs, a simple, data-driven, ensemble-based model that produces estimates of CH4 wetland emissions constrained by observations of precipitation and temperature. This study performs the first detailed global and regional evaluation of the WetCHARTs CH4 emission model ensemble against 9 years of high-quality, validated atmospheric CH4 observations from GOSAT (the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite). A 3-D chemical transport model is used to estimate atmospheric CH4 mixing ratios based on the WetCHARTs emissions and other sources. Across all years and all ensemble members, the observed global seasonal-cycle amplitude is typically underestimated by WetCHARTs by −7.4 ppb, but the correlation coefficient of 0.83 shows that the seasonality is well-produced at a global scale. The Southern Hemisphere has less of a bias (−1.9 ppb) than the Northern Hemisphere (−9.3 ppb), and our findings show that it is typically the North Tropics where this bias is the worst (−11.9 ppb). We find that WetCHARTs generally performs well in reproducing the observed wetland CH4 seasonal cycle for the majority of wetland regions although, for some regions, regardless of the ensemble configuration, WetCHARTs does not reproduce the observed seasonal cycle well. In order to investigate this, we performed detailed analysis of some of the more challenging exemplar regions (Paraná River, Congo, Sudd and Yucatán). Our results show that certain ensemble members are more suited to specific regions, due to either deficiencies in the underlying data driving the model or complexities in representing the processes involved. In particular, incorrect definition of the wetland extent is found to be the most common reason for the discrepancy between the modelled and observed CH4 concentrations. The remaining driving data (i.e. heterotrophic respiration and temperature) are shown to also contribute to the mismatch with observations, with the details differing on a region-by-region basis but generally showing that some degree of temperature dependency is better than none. We conclude that the data-driven approach used by WetCHARTs is well-suited to producing a benchmark ensemble dataset against which to evaluate more complex process-based land surface models that explicitly model the hydrological behaviour of these complex wetland regions.",False,0,,True,0

For environmentally transmitted parasites with transmission mechanisms linked to vegetation structure, fire should exert direct effects on parasites, as well as indirect effects resulting from subsequent enhanced herbivory, which can affect parasite input and exposure to environmental conditions. We combined an experimental manipulation with observational data in the Serengeti National Park to investigate the direct and indirect effects of fire on parasites. We assessed the direct effects of fire by measuring changes in parasitic nematode larvae in the grass layer before and after fire on paired experimental burned and control plots. To investigate indirect effects linked to pyric herbivory, we sampled herbivore dung, grass biomass, ground temperature and larval densities every month for 5 months following fire in seven pairs of burned and unburned monitoring plots. Finally, to assess if fire‐driven changes to larval densities affected host infection burdens, we collected faecal samples from a key host, Grant's gazelle ( Nanger granti ), each month for 5 months to estimate within‐host parasite burdens. Fire killed all larvae and increased grazer dung inputs by 40% for 2 months following fire. Dung inputs after fire led to larval parasite recolonization of burned patches, but intense herbivory kept grass short and larval densities were associated with changes in ground temperature linked to grass biomass and ambient temperature. Grant's gazelles had lower parasite burdens when sampled in areas with higher compared to lower burned area fraction. Fire and pyric herbivory change the densities of larval parasites in the environment and divide the landscape into burned and unburned regions with distinct infection risks for local herbivores. The indirect effects quantified here represent a novel finding with major implications for all grazing systems impacted by fire.",False,0,,True,0

A regularization parameter, which significantly affects the classification performance, has to be chosen and this is usually done by the cross-validation procedure. In this paper, we reformulate the hyperparameter selection problem for support vector classification as a bilevel optimization problem in which the upper-level problem minimizes the average number of misclassified data points over all the cross-validation folds, and the lower-level problems are the $$l_1$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>l</mml:mi> <mml:mn>1</mml:mn> </mml:msub> </mml:math> -loss SVC problems, with each one for each fold in T-fold cross-validation. The resulting bilevel optimization model is then converted to a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC). To solve this MPEC, we propose a global relaxation cross-validation algorithm (GR–CV) based on the well-know Sholtes-type global relaxation method (GRM). It is proven to converge to a C-stationary point. Moreover, we prove that the MPEC-tailored version of the Mangasarian–Fromovitz constraint qualification (MFCQ), which is a key property to guarantee the convergence of the GRM, automatically holds at each feasible point of this MPEC. Extensive numerical results verify the efficiency of the proposed approach. In particular, compared with other methods, our algorithm enjoys superior generalization performance over almost all the data sets used in this paper.",False,0,,True,0

It takes participatory research with lone child migrants as a particularly rich case to think with, given the proliferation of contradictory and often punitive applications of time these young people encounter in their interactions with migration and welfare regimes. The core argument developed is that unless temporality is given due theoretical and methodological attention, aims of contesting and unsettling inequities through participatory research will have limited success and can wind up reproducing exclusions and oppressions. In response to these critiques, the paper temporalizes participatory research through three reconstructions: working with and against time, de-centring shared time and collectivising the time of participatory research.",False,0,,True,0

As such, characterising drought severity and duration is important for ensuring the reliability of the electricity system. Employing concepts derived from hydrology, an extreme value analysis was carried out on wind drought events in Great Britain based on 72 years of ERA5 reanalysis data. The application of pooling procedures was found to be beneficial in robustly identifying wind droughts in cases where the capacity factor is not constantly below an arbitrary threshold. The sequent peak algorithm pooling was found to have particular relevance for electricity systems where energy storage technologies are used to compensate for low wind power generation. The Pearson-III distribution was identified as a suitable model to represent extreme wind droughts, while the Lognormal and Generalised Pareto distributions are also viable alternatives. Sustained periods of low wind power generation with a duration of 14 days were estimated to have a return period of five years and the longest event on record of approximately 26 days is expected to occur once every 100 years. The investigation of these wind droughts from a hydrological perspective has thus shown that they may not be particularly rare occurrences.",False,0,,True,1

The number of papers published in the literature has been steadily increasing with keywords such as ‘hydrogen’ and ‘visible’ becoming prominent research topics. There are likely two primary drivers behind this, the first of which is that biomass represents a more sustainable photocatalytic feedstock for reforming to value-added products and energy. The second is the transition towards achieving net zero emission targets, which has increased focus on the development of technologies that could play a role in future energy systems. Therefore, this review provides a perspective on not only the current state of the research but also a future outlook on the potential roadmap for photocatalytic reforming of biomass. Producing energy via photocatalytic biomass reforming is very desirable due to the ambient operating conditions and potential to utilise renewable energy (e.g., solar) with a wide variety of biomass resources. As both interest and development within this field continues to grow, however, there are challenges being identified that are paramount to further advancement. In reviewing both the literature and trajectory of the field, research priorities can be identified and utilised to facilitate fundamental research alongside whole systems evaluation. Moreover, this would underpin the enhancement of photocatalytic technology with a view towards improving the technology readiness level and promoting engagement between academia and industry.",False,0,,True,0

Most serine and arginine-enriched (SR) protein SFs regulate their own concentration via a homeostatic feedback mechanism that involves regulation of inclusion of non-coding 'poison exons' (PEs) that target transcripts for nonsense-mediated decay. The importance of SR protein PE splicing during animal development is largely unknown despite PE ultra-conservation across animal genomes. To address this, we used mouse genetics to disrupt an ultra-conserved PE in the Tra2b gene encoding the SR protein Tra2β. Focussing on germ cell development, we found that Tra2b PE deletion causes azoospermia due to catastrophic cell death during meiotic prophase. Failure to proceed through meiosis was associated with increased Tra2b expression sufficient to drive aberrant Tra2β protein hyper-responsive splice patterns. Although critical for meiotic prophase, Tra2b PE deletion spared earlier mitotically active germ cells, even though these still required Tra2b gene function. Our data indicate that PE splicing control prevents the accumulation of toxic levels of Tra2β protein that are incompatible with meiotic prophase. This unexpected connection with male fertility helps explain Tra2b PE ultra-conservation and indicates the importance of evaluating PE function in animal models.",False,0,,True,0

Chair-side monitoring of inflammatory mediators of periodontitis could provide immediate information about disease activity, which can inform patient management. We aimed to develop a novel prototype biosensor to measure salivary matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8) using specific antibodies and surface acoustic wave (SAW) technology.

Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis for distinguishing periodontitis from health revealed an almost identical performance between the sensor and ELISA assays (area under curve values (AUC): ELISA 0.93; SAW 0.89). Furthermore, both analytical approaches yielded readouts which distinguished between heath, gingivitis and periodontitis, correlated identically with clinical measures of periodontal disease and recorded similar post-treatment decreases in salivary MMP-8 in periodontitis. The assay time for our prototype device is 20 minutes.

Structural hierarchy, chemical anisotropy, and compositional heterogeneity are ubiquitous in biological systems and play a key role in the functionality of living systems. For decades, methods such as soft lithography have enabled recreation of such arrangements through precise spatial control of molecular patterns in 2D. With technological advances and increasing understanding of molecular and structural biology, there has been an increasing interest in recreating such spatial organizations in 3D. In this review, a comprehensive summary of the latest technologies being used to create 3D patterns of functional molecules within hydrogels for tissue engineering applications is presented. The review is divided into five groups of technologies defined according to the main driving force used to fabricate the patterns including light, precise chemical design, microfluidics, 3D printing, and non‐contact forces (i.e. electric, magnetic, or acoustic fields and self‐assembly).",False,0,,True,0

The persistence of interlocks through to the first meiotic division can jeopardize normal synapsis and occasionally chromosome segregation. However, they are generally removed by pachytene. It has been postulated that interlock removal requires one or more active processes, possibly involving topoisomerase II (TOPII) and/or chromosome movement. However, experimental evidence has been lacking. Analysis of a hypomorphic topII mutant and a meiosis-specific topII RNAi knockdown of Arabidopsis thaliana using immunocytochemistry and structured illumination microscopy (SIM) has now enabled us to demonstrate a role for TOPII in interlock resolution. Furthermore, analysis using a nucleoporin nup136 mutant, which affects chromosome movement, reveals that although TOPII activity is required for the removal of some interlock structures, for others, chromosome movement is also necessary. Thus, our study demonstrates that at least two mechanisms are required to ensure interlock removal.",False,0,,True,0

Yet the fundamental mechanisms of the formation of silicate grains and the early processes that initiate the coupling of the silicon with the oxygen chemistries in circumstellar envelopes have remained obscure. Here, in a crossed molecular beams experiment combined with ab initio electronic structure calculations, we reveal that at least the d 2-silaformaldehyde (D 2 SiO) and d 2-hydroxysilylene (DSiOD) molecules—proxies for the astronomically elusive silaformaldehyde (H 2 SiO) and hydroxysilylene (HSiOH) molecules—can be synthesized via the reaction of the D1-silylidyne radical (SiD; X 2 Π) with D2-water (D 2 O) under single-collision conditions. This system represents a benchmark of a previously overlooked class of reactions, in which the silicon–oxygen bond coupling can be initiated by a reaction between the simplest silicon-bearing radical (silylidyne) and one of the most abundant species in the circumstellar envelopes of evolved oxygen-rich AGB stars (water). As supported by novel astrochemical modeling, considering that silicon- and oxygen-containing species like H 2 SiO and HSiOH might be photolyzed easily, they ultimately connect to simple molecular precursors such as SiO that drive a chain of reactions conceivably forming higher molecular weight silicon oxides and, ultimately, a population of silicates at high temperatures.",False,0,,True,0

Creating and maintaining such resources can be complex, since a particular medication may have divergent effects in different individuals, due to specific patient characteristics and/or interactions with other drugs being administered. Textual information from various sources can provide important evidence to curators of PV databases about the usage and effects of drug targets in different medical subjects. However, the efficient identification of relevant evidence can be challenging, due to the increasing volume of textual data. Text mining (TM) techniques can support curators by automatically detecting complex information, such as interactions between drugs, diseases and adverse effects. This semantic information supports the quick identification of documents containing information of interest (e.g., the different types of patients in which a given adverse drug reaction has been observed to occur).

We present a semantically annotated corpus of 597 MEDLINE abstracts, PHAEDRA, encoding rich information on drug effects and their interactions, whose quality is assured through the use of detailed annotation guidelines and the demonstration of high levels of inter-annotator agreement (e.g., 92.6% F-Score for identifying named entities and 78.4% F-Score for identifying complex events, when relaxed matching criteria are applied). To our knowledge, the corpus is unique in the domain of PV, according to the level of detail of its annotations.

As Bell's theorem shows, within a given causal structure, classical and quantum physics impose different constraints on the correlations that are realizable, a fundamental feature that has technological applications. However, in general it is difficult to distinguish the set of classical and quantum correlations within a causal structure. Here we investigate a method to do this based on using entropy vectors for Tsallis entropies. We derive constraints on the Tsallis entropies that are implied by (conditional) independence between classical random variables and apply these to causal structures. We find that the number of independent constraints needed to characterize the causal structure is prohibitively high such that the computations required for the standard entropy vector method cannot be employed even for small causal structures. Instead, without solving the whole problem, we find new Tsallis entropic constraints for the triangle causal structure by generalizing known Shannon constraints. Our results reveal mathematical properties of classical and quantum Tsallis entropies and highlight difficulties of using Tsallis entropies for analyzing causal structures.",False,0,,True,0

Four moorings equipped with dual sediment traps, 100 m and 1000 m above the sea floor, sampled regions north and south of the Charlie Gibbs Fracture Zone (between 49°N and 54°N) and east and west of the MAR. Biogenic data were coupled with satellite estimates of primary production and modelled particle source to assess the variability in export flux. Large variations were found in the seasonality, chemical composition, magnitude and source of sinking particulate material between mooring sites. The northern moorings recorded both greater mean primary production and greater particle mass flux than the southern moorings, although, the large inter-annual variability within the sites exceeded inter-site differences. While estimates of primary production and organic carbon fluxes are comparable to other investigations of this type, they are notably lower than previous estimates for the abyssal plain of the North Atlantic. The deeper traps consistently recorded a higher mass flux compared to the shallower traps. However, we suggest that the overall flux recorded by the shallower traps was reduced by trapping inefficiency, which in the light of the low current velocities, may largely be due to the physical nature of the sinking material.

This is premised on the fact that anthropology often functions as an intimate double and handmaiden of biomedicine, in so far as it refuses to countenance the possibility of theurgic aetiologies in the realm of what is called 'mental illness'. Such a refusal displaces native explanations of divine or demonic agency to human agency. This is best elucidated by examining the unexamined religious beliefs of Anglo-European anthropology, which appears to be the terra firma of its emic explanatory categories. The paper attempts to demonstrate this by proposing that while native explanations are akin to the sacraments, anthropological explanations are akin to sacramentals (holy water, the cross, the scapular, verbal blessings). While the sacraments, like divine agency, operate ex opere operato, the sacramentals are dependent on the disposition of the recipient and on the good offices of the church, as they operate ex opere operantis ecclesiae (from the work of the working church), as well as ex opere operantis (from the work of the working one). If the sacraments are efficacious as it is work done by Christ alone, and akin to work done by the possessing agent, sacramentals are efficacious as they are also dependent on human agency. In other words, anthropological explanations are, at best, 'sacramental' as they replace emic theurgic explanations by etic ones, where human agency in the form of the priest, the institution of the church, and the lay person who is the recipient of divine dispensation, also have a role to play; or, as is often the case, the only role to play.",False,0,,True,0

Dispersing nanoparticles within the bulk of oxides is, however, synthetically much more challenging and therefore less explored, but could open new dimensions to control material properties analogous to substitutional doping of ions in crystal lattices. Here we demonstrate such a concept allowing extensive, controlled growth of metallic nanoparticles, at nanoscale proximity, within a perovskite oxide lattice as well as on its surface. By employing operando techniques, we show that in the emergent nanostructure, the endogenous nanoparticles and the perovskite lattice become reciprocally strained and seamlessly connected, enabling enhanced oxygen exchange. Additionally, even deeply embedded nanoparticles can reversibly exchange oxygen with a methane stream, driving its redox conversion to syngas with remarkable selectivity and long term cyclability while surface particles are present. These results not only exemplify the means to create extensive, self‐strained nanoarchitectures with enhanced oxygen transport and storage capabilities, but also demonstrate that deeply submerged, redox‐active nanoparticles could be entirely accessible to reaction environments, driving redox transformations and thus offering intriguing new alternatives to design materials underpinning several energy conversion technologies.",False,0,,True,1

Employing renewable, environment friendly and naturally available biomass feedstock as precursor for producing carbon materials is a low-cost and sustainable way for designing the electrodes of supercapacitors. In the present study, high surface area hierarchical porous multilayered graphene-like carbon is obtained via room temperature sono-exfoliation of the activated carbon synthesized via simple and environmentally friendly hydrothermal carbonization and potassium bicarbonate activation of waste hazelnut shells as the precursor. The high surface area graphene-like carbon showed excellent electrochemical performance with specific capacitance of 320.9 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 current density and exceptional capacitance retention of 77.8% at 2 A g−1 current density after 10 000 cycles in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Moreover, flexible supercapacitors fabricated using sono-exfoliated graphene-like activated carbon coated stainless steel mesh electrodes and biopolymer gel electrolyte exhibits an outstanding energy density of 38.7 W h kg−1 and power density of 198.4 W kg−1.

The Short Synacthen Test (SST) is the current diagnostic test of choice for AI, but it is both invasive and resource intensive. Globally, there is an unmet need for a non-invasive, cost-effective test. A novel formulation, Nasacthin, has been developed, which can be delivered intranasally, with the resultant glucocorticoid levels measured in saliva instead of blood. The Salivary Test of Adrenal Response to Liquid Intranasal Tetracosactide (STARLIT-2) study aims to clinically validate the Nasacthin test in healthy volunteers. STARLIT-2 is a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, four-way crossover trial. 32 healthy adults and children will be randomised to receive each of four study drugs (Synacthen, Nasacthin and their respective placebos) over four study visits (one per visit). Paired blood and saliva samples will be collected from participants at baseline, and then at 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after drug administration. Additional salivary samples will be collected at 180, 240, 360 and 480 min after drug administration. The primary outcome measures are to compare the mean serum cortisol at 30 min after Synacthen or Nasacthin dose, with a view to determine non-inferiority; and to compare the mean change from baseline in serum cortisol at 30 min after active and placebo doses of both Synacthen and Nasacthin, aiming to demonstrate superiority of active over placebo. In addition, the proportion of participants for which Nasacthin produces a rise above a preset serum cortisol threshold at 30 min will be determined, with the negative per cent agreement with the SST calculated using the SST as the reference standard. The study and its amendments have been reviewed and approved by South Central-Hampshire A Research Ethics Committee. Results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations, and feedback to trial participants will be facilitated following consultation with patient and public involvement and engagement groups.

As the molecular properties of either mirror image isomer are identical, these changes must be a result of the different bulk packing induced by chiral composition. Such underlying structures are investigated using crystal structure prediction, a computational methodology rarely applied to molecular materials, and linked to the difference in charge transport.

Here, the trigger(s) for 2-MIB and Geosmin production were investigated in Plas Uchaf reservoir (North Wales, UK) with detailed water sample analysis between 2015 and 2016. Historical abstraction data from this reservoir and 4 reservoirs in Somerset (England, UK) were compared statistically using Self-Organising Map (SOM) analysis. In-reservoir measurements (2015-2016) revealed an 85% reduction in ammonium from the primary external loading source led to lower 2-MIB and Geosmin concentrations, with peak concentrations of 2-MIB declining from 60 to 21 ng l-1 and Geosmin declining from 140 to 18 ng l-1. No other measured water chemistry parameter showed a significant difference between years. The SOM results support the in-reservoir findings, revealing 2-MIB and Geosmin to be associated with high ammonium relative to nitrate for all 5 reservoirs. We conclude that ammonium is key for stimulating cyanobacterial productivity and production of T&O compounds. Whilst it is well understood that adequate availability of phosphorus is required for rapid growth in cyanobacteria, and hence should still be considered in management decisions, we suggest that monitoring sources and concentrations of ammonium is key for managing T&O outbreaks in drinking water reservoirs.",False,0,,True,0

Palliative care need in SSA is significant, however, most countries in the region have limited provision. mHealth (i.e. medical and public health practice supported by mobile devices) is an approach that may support increased access and communication with palliative care services. However, there is a limited understanding of health professionals' views and perceptions on its use in the delivery of cancer care. We sought to understand health professionals' views and perceptions of the use of mHealth as part of palliative care delivery. Transcripts from interviews of health professionals in Uganda (n = 20) were analysed thematically. The majority of participants were female (75%, n = 15). Average duration of experience was 15.8 years as healthcare providers and 8.2 years as palliative care providers. Four overarching themes were derived from the analysis: (i) current use of mHealth in palliative cancer care provision; (ii) advantages of using mHealth in palliative cancer care; (iii) challenges to providing palliative cancer care using mHealth, and; (iv) preferences for mHealth use in palliative cancer care. mHealth is considered advantageous for the provision of palliative cancer care. There is a need to adapt training to improve competencies of palliative care professionals in delivery of care that leverages digital technologies. Development of mHealth initiatives needs to consider how best to maintain patient privacy and ensure inequities in access to care are not worsened.",False,0,,True,0

The number and complexity of experiments examining the effects of OA has substantially increased over the past decade, in an attempt to address multi-stressor interactions and long-term responses in an increasing range of aquatic organisms. However, differences in the response of males and females to elevated p CO 2 have been investigated in fewer than 4% of studies to date, often being precluded by the difficulty of determining sex non-destructively, particularly in early life stages. Here we highlight that sex can significantly impact organism responses to OA, differentially affecting physiology, reproduction, biochemistry and ultimately survival. What is more, these impacts do not always conform to ecological theory based on differential resource allocation towards reproduction, which would predict females to be more sensitive to OA owing to the higher production cost of eggs compared with sperm. Therefore, non-sex-specific studies may overlook subtle but ecologically significant differences in the responses of males and females to OA, with consequences for forecasting the fate of natural populations in a near-future ocean.",False,0,,True,0

The work presented here investigates how the hydration of ceramide and phosphatidylcholine headgroups in a solution compares with that found in a lipid bilayer. This work shows that the hydration patterns seen in the solution samples provide valuable insight into the preferential location of hydrating water molecules in the bilayer. There are certain subtle differences in the distribution, which result from a combination of the lipid conformation and the lipid-lipid interactions within the bilayer environment. The lipid-lipid interactions in the bilayer will be dependent on the composition of the bilayer, whereas the restricted exploration of conformational space is likely to be applicable in all membrane environments.

This article provides an experimental study of various factors on DC breakdown of electronegative gases. Rod-plane geometries with a range of rod diameters (3.5–12.5 mm) and electrode separations (5–55 mm) are used to provide different degrees of field uniformity. SF6 and a 20% C3F7CN / 80% CO2 mixture are tested under pressures ranging between 1 and 5 bar. Breakdown voltages (BDVs) under both polarities rise linearly with gap distance in quasi-uniform fields with the positive being higher. Increasingly nonuniform fields lead to saturation in the case of positive BDV, while in the negative polarity case, the BDV increases linearly. As a result, the two polarities' BDV magnitudes crossover as field nonuniformity increases. The value at which the negative value exceeds the positive is dependent on the field uniformity, pressure, and gas medium. A simulation based on the streamer criterion model provides a good agreement with experimental results for positive DC breakdown in the range of 2–5 bar. In terms of the insulation characteristics, 20% C3F7CN / 80% CO2 could provide a valuable alternative to SF6 in high-voltage plant for outdoor applications in hot-climate countries and indoor applications in cold-climate countries.",False,0,,True,0

A key unknown is how to remobilise and erupt such crystal-rich material, and whether the growth of gas bubbles within the mush could promote remobilisation. In order to investigate this, we need improved constraints on the timing of volatile saturation in magmas. The mineral apatite represents a potentially useful record of pre-eruptive magmatic volatiles, but data interpretation is complex because exchange reactions control the volatile partitioning. Model solutions are therefore non-unique. Here, we present a numerical forward modelling program with a sensitivity analysis function, which addresses non-uniqueness by identifying alternative sets of starting parameters that match a target compositional trend through a population of apatite crystals. The model is applied to a new dataset of volatiles in apatite from the 12.9 ka Laacher See eruption, Eifel volcanic region, Germany. The results indicate that the magma was initially strongly volatile-undersaturated and became saturated through progressive crystal fractionation. Apatite crystals are not in volatile or trace element equilibrium with their carrier melts, indicating dispersal of crystals into different chemical environments.

However, a degeneracy in the information carried by gravitational waves between the total rest-frame mass $M$ and the redshift $z$ of the source implies that neither can be directly extracted from the signal, but only the combination $M(1+z)$, the redshifted mass. Recent work has shown that for binary neutron star systems, a tidal correction to the gravitational-wave phase in the late-inspiral signal that depends on the rest-frame source mass could be used to break the mass-redshift degeneracy. We propose here to use the signature encoded in the post-merger signal to deduce the redshift to the source. This will allow an accurate extraction of the intrinsic rest-frame mass of the source, in turn permitting the determination of source redshift and luminosity distance solely from gravitational-wave observations. This will herald a new era in precision cosmography and astrophysics. Using numerical simulations of binary neutron star mergers of very slightly different mass, we model gravitational-wave signals at different redshifts and use Bayesian parameter estimation to determine the accuracy with which the redshift can be extracted for a source of known mass. We find that the Einstein Telescope can determine the source redshift to $sim 10$--$20%$ at redshifts of $z<0.04$.",False,0,,True,0

Agricultural researchers use ground-based observations to identify, select and develop crops with favourable genotypes and phenotypes; however, the ability to collect rapid, high quality and high volume phenotypic data in open fields is restricting this. This study develops and assesses a method for deriving crop height and growth rate rapidly from multi-temporal, very high spatial resolution (1 cm/pixel), 3D digital surface models of crop field trials produced via Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry using aerial imagery collected through repeated campaigns flying an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with a mounted Red Green Blue (RGB) camera. We compare UAV SfM modelled crop heights to those derived from terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) and to the standard field measurement of crop height conducted using a 2 m rule. The most accurate UAV-derived surface model and the TLS both achieve a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.03 m compared to the existing manual 2 m rule method. The optimised UAV method was then applied to the growing season of a winter wheat field phenotyping experiment containing 25 different varieties grown in 27 m2 plots and subject to four different nitrogen fertiliser treatments. Accuracy assessments at different stages of crop growth produced consistently low RMSE values (0.07, 0.02 and 0.03 m for May, June and July, respectively), enabling crop growth rate to be derived from differencing of the multi-temporal surface models. We find growth rates range from −13 mm/day to 17 mm/day. Our results clearly display the impact of variable nitrogen fertiliser rates on crop growth. Digital surface models produced provide a novel spatial mapping of crop height variation both at the field scale and also within individual plots.

The evaluation of genetic potential of crops under limited resource inputs such as limited N supply would provide an opportunity to identify N-efficient lines with improved N utilisation efficiency and yield potential. We assessed the genetic variation in wheat recombinant inbred lines (RILs) for uptake, partitioning, and remobilization of N towards grain, its association with grain protein concentration (GPC) and grain yield. Methods We used the nested association mapping (NAM) population (195 lines) derived by crossing Paragon (P) with CIMMYT core germplasm (P × Cim), Baj (P × Baj), Watkins (P × Wat), and Wyalkatchem (P × Wya). These lines were evaluated in the field for two seasons under limited N supply. The plant sampling was done at anthesis and physiological maturity stages. Various physiological traits were recorded and total N uptake and other N related indices were calculated. The grain protein deviation (GPD) was calculated from the regression of grain yield on GPC. These lines were grouped into different clusters by hierarchical cluster analysis based on grain yield and N-remobilization efficiency (NRE). Results The genetic variation in accumulation of biomass at both pre- and post-anthesis stages were correlated with grain-yield. The NRE significantly correlated with aboveground N uptake at anthesis (AGNa) and grain yield but negatively associated with AGN at post-anthesis (AGNpa) suggesting higher N uptake till anthesis favours high N remobilization during grain filling. Hierarchical cluster analysis of these RILs based on NRE and yield resulted in four clusters, efficient (31), moderately efficient (59), moderately inefficient (58), and inefficient (47). In the N-efficient lines, AGNa contributed to 77% of total N accumulated in grains, while it was 63% in N-inefficient lines. Several N-efficient lines also exhibited positive grain protein deviation (GPD), combining high grain yield and GPC. Among crosses, the P × Cim were superior and N-efficient, while P × Wya responded poorly to low N input. Conclusions We propose that traits favouring pre- or post-anthesis biomass accumulation and pre-anthesis N uptake may be targeted for breeding to improve grain-yield under limited N. The lines with positive GPD, a first report of genotype-dependent GPD associated with both AGNpa and AGNa in wheat, may be used as varieties or genetic resources to improve grain yield with high GPC for sustainable development under limited N conditions.",False,0,,True,0

However, the scenario becomes more complicated when the loading inputs are of more general form such as multi-tone and random inputs, which can produce system responses that are induced by an interaction of system input components of different frequencies. In the present study, by introducing the concept of power transmissibility, the study of the beneficial effects of nonlinear damping is extended to the systems subject to general inputs including both multi-tone and random inputs. A rigorous analysis is conducted based on single degree of freedom systems subject to general inputs. The analysis reveals the conditions under which the antisymmetric nonlinear damping is beneficial for improving energy harvester performance and reducing of the power of system output in vibration isolation.

Although the use of such substrates is advantageous because of the high surface‐to‐volume ratio, cell harvest from the same substrates is a challenge as it requires enzymatic treatment, often combined with agitation. Here, we investigated a two‐phase system for expansion and non‐enzymatic recovery of hMSCs. Perfluorocarbon droplets were dispersed in a protein‐rich growth medium and were used as temporary liquid microcarriers for hMSC culture. RESULTS hMSCs successfully attached to these liquid microcarriers, exhibiting similar morphologies to those cultured on solid ones. Fold increases of 3.03 ± 0.98 (hMSC1) and 3.81 ± 0.29 (hMSC2) were achieved on day 9. However, the maximum expansion folds were recorded on day 4 (4.79 ± 0.47 (hMSC1) and 4.856 ± 0.7 (hMSC2)). This decrease was caused by cell aggregation upon reaching confluency due to the contraction of the interface between the two phases. Cell quality, as assessed by differentiation, cell surface marker expression and clonogenic ability, was retained post expansion on the liquid microcarriers. Cell harvesting was achieved non‐enzymatically in two steps: first by inducing droplet coalescence and then aspirating the interface. Quality characteristics of hMSCs continued to be retained even after inducing droplet coalescence. CONCLUSION The prospect of a temporary microcarrier that can be used to expand cells and then ‘disappear’ for cell release without using proteolytic enzymes is a very exciting one. Here, we have demonstrated that hMSCs can attach and proliferate on these perfluorocarbon liquid microcarriers while, very importantly, retaining their quality.",False,0,,True,1

The presented antenna can be equivalent as a combination of a six-port power divider and four crossed folded dipoles. The six-port power divider is composed of two orthogonal input ports and four equal magnitude output ports. Detailed analysis illustrates that the six-port power divider can have wide bandwidth and high isolation under odd-mode excitation and high common-mode suppression under even-mode excitation. Therefore, based on the wideband and high even-mode suppressed six-port power divider, a wideband differentially driven dual-polarized antenna is developed with high common-mode suppression. To validate the design concept, the proposed antenna was designed, fabricated, and measured. The measured results prove that the antenna has a wide impedance bandwidth of 1.64-3.0 GHz (58.6%) for the return loss higher than 15 dB and isolation higher than 35.4 dB. In addition, very high common-mode suppression is achieved for the measured common-mode reflection coefficient higher than -0.87 dB over the entire bandwidth. With stable antenna gain and half-power beamwidth, the developed antenna is suitable for base station applications.",False,0,,True,0

However, their luminous efficacy for green and amber emission and at high drive currents remains limited. Growing quantum wells instead in the cubic phase is a promising alternative because, compared to hexagonal GaN, it benefits from a reduced bandgap and is free of the strong polarization fields that can reduce the radiative recombination rate. Initial attempts to grow cubic GaN in the 1990s employed molecular beam epitaxy, but now, metal-organic chemical vapor deposition can also be used. Nonetheless, high phase purity requires careful attention to growth conditions and the quantification of any unwanted hexagonal phase. In contrast to hexagonal GaN, in which threading dislocations are key, at its current state of maturity, the most important extended structural defects in cubic GaN are stacking faults. These modify the optical properties of cubic GaN films and propagate into active layers. In quantum wells and electron blocking layers, segregation of alloying elements at stacking faults has been observed, leading to the formation of quantum wires and polarized emission. This observation forms part of a developing understanding of the optical properties of cubic InGaN quantum wells, which also offer shorter recombination lifetimes than their polar hexagonal counterparts. There is also growing expertise in p-doping, including dopant activation by annealing. Overall, cubic GaN has rapidly transitioned from an academic curiosity to a real prospect for application in devices, with the potential to offer specific performance advantages compared to polar hexagonal material.",False,0,,True,0

Conversely, pathogens can subvert protein phosphorylation to control host immune responses and facilitate invasion and dissemination. The bacterial effectors EspJ and SeoC are injected into host cells through a type III secretion system by enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EPEC and EHEC, respectively), Citrobacter rodentium , and Salmonella enterica , where they inhibit Src kinase by coupled amidation and ADP-ribosylation. C. rodentium , which is used to model EPEC and EHEC infections in humans, is a mouse pathogen triggering colonic crypt hyperplasia (CCH) and colitis. Enumeration of bacterial shedding and CCH confirmed that EspJ affects neither tolerance nor resistance to infection. However, comparison of the proteomes of intestinal epithelial cells isolated from mice infected with wild-type C. rodentium or C. rodentium encoding catalytically inactive EspJ revealed that EspJ-induced ADP-ribosylation regulates multiple nonreceptor tyrosine kinases in vivo . Investigation of the substrate repertoire of EspJ revealed that in HeLa and A549 cells, Src and Csk were significantly targeted; in polarized Caco2 cells, EspJ targeted Src and Csk and the Src family kinase (SFK) Yes1, while in differentiated Thp1 cells, EspJ modified Csk, the SFKs Hck and Lyn, the Tec family kinases Tec and Btk, and the adapter tyrosine kinase Syk. Furthermore, Abl (HeLa and Caco2) and Lyn (Caco2) were enriched specifically in the EspJ-containing samples. Biochemical assays revealed that EspJ, the only bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferase that targets mammalian kinases, controls immune responses and the Src/Csk signaling axis. IMPORTANCE Enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EPEC and EHEC, respectively) strains cause significant mortality and morbidity worldwide. Citrobacter rodentium is a mouse pathogen used to model EPEC and EHEC pathogenesis in vivo . Diarrheal disease is triggered following injection of bacterial effectors, via a type III secretion system (T3SS), into intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). While insights into the role of the effectors were historically obtained from pathological, immunologic, or cell culture phenotypes, subtle roles of individual effectors in vivo are often masked. The aim of this study was to elucidate the role and specificity of the ADP-ribosyltransferase effector EspJ. For the first time, we show that the in vivo processes affected by a T3SS effector can be studied by comparing the proteomes of IECs extracted from mice infected with wild-type C. rodentium or an espJ catalytic mutant. We show that EspJ, the only bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferase that targets mammalian kinases, regulates the host immune response in vivo .",False,0,,True,0

Nevertheless, merely metal-based NoC implementation offers only limited performance and power scalability in terms of multicast and broadcast traffics. To meet scalability demands, this paper addresses the system-level challenges for intra-chip multicast communication in a proposed hybrid interconnects architecture. This hybrid NoC combines and utilizes both regular metal on-chip interconnects and new type of wireless-NoC (WiNoC) which is Zenneck surface wave interconnects (SWI). Moreover, this paper embeds novel multicast routing and arbitration schemes to address system-level multicast-challenges in the proposed architecture. Specifically, a design exploration of contention handling in SWI layer is considered in both centralized and decentralized manners. Consequently, the hybrid wire-SWI architecture avoids overloading the network, alleviates the formation of traffic hotspots and avoid deadlocks that are typically associated with state-of-the-art multicast handling. The evaluation is based on a cycle-accurate simulation and hardware description. It demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed architecture in terms of power consumption (up to around 10x) and performance (around 22x) compared to regular NoCs. These results are achieved with negligible hardware overheads.

Here $\lambda$ is the deformation parameter, plausibly the Planck scale. We find that $r,t,dr,dt$ are all forced to be central, i.e. undeformed at order $\lambda$, while for each value of $r,t$ we are forced to have a fuzzy sphere of radius $r$ with a unique differential calculus which is necessarily nonassociative at order $\lambda^2$.

In this work, the performance of lipid-based formulations with the addition of medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) or surfactants to the sesame oil vehicle has been tested in vitro and in vivo using CBD as a model drug. The in vitro lipolysis has shown that addition of the MCT leads to a higher distribution of CBD into the micellar phase. Further addition of surfactants to MCT-containing formulations did not improve distribution of the drug into the micellar phase. In vivo, formulations containing MCT led to lower or similar concentrations of CBD in serum, lymph and MLNs, but with reduced variability. MCT improves the emulsification and micellar solubilization of CBD, but surfactants did not facilitate further the rate and extent of lipolysis. Even though addition of MCT reduces the variability, the in vivo performance for the extent of both lymphatic transport and systemic bioavailability remains superior with a pure natural oil vehicle.",False,0,,True,0

Mutations in dynein-2 components cause skeletal ciliopathies, notably Jeune syndrome. Dynein-2 contains a heterodimer of two non-identical intermediate chains, WDR34 and WDR60. Here, we use knockout cell lines to demonstrate that each intermediate chain has a distinct role in cilium function. Using quantitative proteomics, we show that WDR34 KO cells can assemble a dynein-2 motor complex that binds IFT proteins yet fails to extend an axoneme, indicating complex function is stalled. In contrast, WDR60 KO cells do extend axonemes but show reduced assembly of dynein-2 and binding to IFT proteins. Both proteins are required to maintain a functional transition zone and for efficient bidirectional intraflagellar transport. Our results indicate that the subunit asymmetry within the dynein-2 complex is matched with a functional asymmetry between the dynein-2 intermediate chains. Furthermore, this work reveals that loss of function of dynein-2 leads to defects in transition zone architecture, as well as intraflagellar transport.",False,0,,True,0

We investigated the effect of citrate (CIT) on CaCO3 crystallization by monitoring crystallization rates and crystal polymorph, size, and morphology as a function of increasing mol % CIT/Ca ([Ca2+] = [CO32–] = 4 mM). At CIT/Ca ≤ 50%, both vaterite and calcite formed, but nucleation and growth were retarded as CIT/Ca was increased, demonstrated by the increase in induction time and decrease in the reaction rate constant, fitted using the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov model. This is partly explained by increased CIT-Ca complexation with higher [CIT], thus reducing saturation state with respect to vaterite and calcite. Simultaneously, CIT sorption inhibited crystal growth, demonstrated by smaller vaterite spheres and more elongated calcite crystals as CIT/Ca increased. At CIT/Ca ≥ 75%, vaterite formation was completely inhibited, with only elongated calcite forming and growth rate decreased further as CIT/Ca was increased. Overall, citrate inhibited growth rates most at CIT/Ca ≤ 50%, while nucleation was less affected. In contrast, at CIT/Ca > 50%, citrate strongly inhibited nucleation but had less effect on the growth rate. The results illustrate the spectrum of impacts that complexing compounds can have on CaCO3 crystallization, by forming complexes in solution, affecting CaCO3 saturation state, and also by interacting with the crystal surfaces, thereby controlling nucleation and growth. The extent and the type of effect depend on concentration regimes.",False,0,,True,0

However, after dental replacement and sequential molar development, the dental lamina undergoes apoptosis and fragments, leaving scattered epithelial units (dental lamina rests; DLRs). DLRs in adult humans are considered inactive epithelia, thought to possess limited capacity for further regeneration. However, we show that these tissues contain a small proportion of proliferating cells (assessed by both Ki67 and PCNA) but also express a number of common dental stem cell markers (Sox2, Bmi1, β-catenin and PH3) similar to that observed in many vertebrates that actively, and continuously regenerate their dentition. We compared these human tissues with the dental lamina of sharks that regenerate their dentition throughout life, providing evidence that human tissues have the capacity for further and undocumented regeneration. We also assessed cases of human ameloblastoma to characterise further the proliferative signature of dental lamina rests. Ameloblastomas are assumed to derive from aberrant lamina rests that undergo changes, which are not well understood, to form a benign tumour. We suggest that dental lamina rests can offer a potential source of important dental stem cells for future dental regenerative therapy. The combined developmental genetic data from the shark dental lamina and ameloblastoma may lead to the development of novel methods to utilise these rested populations of adult lamina stem cells for controlled tooth replacement in humans.",False,0,,True,0

Pollen are hygroscopic; therefore, they have the potential to act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in the atmosphere. This could have uncertain implications for cloud processes and climate as well as plant biodiversity and human health. Previous studies have investigated the hygroscopic swelling of pollen, linked to CCN activity by the κ-Köhler theory, using methods that follow observed mass increase by electrodynamic balance (EDB) or vapour sorption analyser. This study uses an acoustic levitator to levitate pollen grains in the true aerosol phase and uses a macroscope to image the pollen to investigate hygroscopic behaviour when relative humidity (RH) is changed. Two pollen species were studied in this work: Lilium orientalis (oriental lily) and Populus deltoides (eastern cottonwood). Both species were successfully levitated; however, the smaller Populus deltoides showed greater instability throughout experiments. The quality of images taken by the macroscope, and thus calculations of pollen area and aspect ratio, varied significantly and were sensitive to lighting conditions as well as to levitated pollen grain movement and orientation. Experiments with surface-fixed pollen grains were also conducted. They showed evidence that pollen hygroscopic swelling could be observed by the macroscope. The produced results were comparable with previously reported mass increase values. Although less accurate than methods that measure mass changes, the acoustic levitator and macroscope set-up offer an attractive alternative by virtue of being commercial, off-the-shelf, low-cost, and versatile techniques. A key advantage of this method is that it is possible to visually observe particle shape dynamics under varying environmental conditions.",False,0,,True,0

Our primary aim is to provide an evidence base, identify key gaps in knowledge and highlight initiatives that will help develop and improve strategies for pollinator conservation. Human‐dominated landscapes (such as arable land and urban environments) can have detrimental impacts on pollinator communities but these negative effects can be ameliorated by proximity to semi‐natural habitat and habitat corridors. There is also evidence to suggest that increased landscape heterogeneity and landscape configuration can play an important role in the maintenance of diverse pollinator communities. Landscape characteristics have direct impacts on pollinator communities, but can also influence abundance and richness through interaction with other drivers such as changing climate or increased chemical inputs in land management. The majority of existing literature focuses on specific hymenopteran groups, but there is a lack of information on the impact of landscape changes on non‐bee taxa. Research is also needed on the effectiveness of management interventions for pollinators and multiple year observations are required for both urban and rural initiatives. Current policies and monitoring schemes could contribute data that will plug gaps in knowledge, thus enabling greater understanding of relationships between landscapes and pollinator populations. This would in turn help design mitigation and adaptation strategies for pollinator conservation. A lay summary is available for this article.",False,0,,True,0

This study analyses the aspects of regional UK precipitation and meteorological drought climatology with respect to a new set of objectively defined weather patterns. These new patterns are currently being used by the Met Office in several probabilistic forecasting applications driven by ensemble forecasting systems. Weather pattern definitions and daily occurrences are mapped to Lamb weather types (LWTs), and parallels between the two classifications are drawn. Daily precipitation distributions are associated with each weather pattern and LWT. Standardized precipitation index (SPI) and drought severity index (DSI) series are calculated for a range of aggregation periods and seasons. Monthly weather‐pattern frequency anomalies are calculated for SPI wet and dry periods and for the 5% most intense DSI‐based drought months. The new weather‐pattern definitions and daily occurrences largely agree with their respective LWTs, allowing comparison between the two classifications. There is also broad agreement between weather pattern and LWT changes in frequencies. The new data set is shown to be adequate for precipitation‐based analyses in the UK, although a smaller set of clustered weather patterns is not. Furthermore, intra‐pattern precipitation variability is lower in the new classification compared to the LWTs, which is an advantage in this context. Six of the new weather patterns are associated with drought over the entire UK, with several other patterns linked to regional drought. It is demonstrated that the new data set of weather patterns offers a new opportunity for classification‐based analyses in the UK.",False,0,,True,1

These systems are selected to be close analogues to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the most massive satellite of the MW. The simulations allow us to address, in a cosmological context, the impact of the Clouds on the MW, including the contribution of Magellanic satellites to the MW satellite population, and the constraints placed on the Galactic potential by the motion of the LMC. We show that LMC-like satellites are twice more common around Local Group-like primaries than around isolated halos of similar mass; these satellites come from large turnaround radii and are on highly eccentric orbits whose velocities at first pericentre are comparable with the primary's escape velocity. This implies $V_{\rm esc}^{\rm MW} (50 $ kpc$)\sim 365$ km/s, a strong constraint on Galactic potential models. LMC analogues contribute about 2 satellites with $M_*>10^5\, M_\odot$, having thus only a mild impact on the luminous satellite population of their hosts. At first pericentre, LMC-associated satellites are close to the LMC in position and velocity, and are distributed along the LMC's orbital plane. Their orbital angular momenta roughly align with the LMC's, but, interestingly, they may appear to ""counter-rotate"" the MW in some cases. These criteria refine earlier estimates of the LMC association of MW satellites: only the SMC, Hydrus1, Car3, Hor1, Tuc4, Ret2 and Phoenix2 are compatible with all criteria. Carina, Grus2, Hor2 and Fornax are less probable associates given their large LMC relative velocity.",False,0,,True,0

Despite its endemic nature, historically, little research has been undertaken to support the control of the disease in NI. This study offers the first attempt to analyse the psychological and behavioural factors influencing farmers’ intentions to implement effective sheep scab control measures in NI. To achieve our objective, quantitative data from a sample of 126 sheep farmers were statistically analysed using an extended theory of planned behaviour approach in an ordered logistic regression modelling framework. Our analyses showed that sheep scab remains an issue of concern in Northern Ireland. The attitudes of the farmers, as well as perceived behavioural control, emotional effect, membership of Business Development Groups (BDGs), and higher education qualifications, were found to be statistically significant factors influencing farmers’ intentions to adopt sheep scab control measures. This study provides a solid foundation for how to promote behavioural changes among sheep farmers to improve their ability to implement effective disease control measures, helping to tackle this challenging disease in a more sustainable way in the future.",False,0,,True,0

Previously, we showed that genetic factors explain 40% of the variation in end of lay bone quality and we detected a quantitative trait locus (QTL) of large effect on chicken chromosome 1. The aim of this study was to combine data from the commercial founder White Leghorn population and the F2 mapping population to fine-map this QTL and understand its function in terms of gene expression and physiology. Results Several single nucleotide polymorphisms on chromosome 1 between 104 and 110 Mb (galGal6) had highly significant associations with tibial breaking strength. The alternative genotypes of markers of large effect that flanked the region had tibial breaking strengths of 200.4 vs. 218.1 Newton (P &lt; 0.002) and, in a subsequent founder generation, the higher breaking strength genotype was again associated with higher breaking strength. In a subsequent generation, cortical bone density and volume were increased in individuals with the better bone genotype but with significantly reduced medullary bone quality. The effects on cortical bone density were confirmed in a further generation and was accompanied by increased mineral maturity of the cortical bone as measured by infrared spectrometry and there was evidence of better collagen cross-linking in the cortical bone. Comparing the transcriptome of the tibia from individuals with good or poor bone quality genotypes indicated four differentially-expressed genes at the locus, one gene, cystathionine beta synthase ( CBS ), having a nine-fold higher expression in the genotype for low bone quality. The mechanism was cis -acting and although there was an amino-acid difference in the CBS protein between the genotypes, there was no difference in the activity of the enzyme. Plasma homocysteine concentration, the substrate of CBS, was higher in the poor bone quality genotype. Conclusions Validated markers that predict bone strength have been defined for selective breeding and a gene was identified that may suggest alternative ways to improve bone health in addition to genetic selection. The identification of how genetic variants affect different aspects of bone turnover shows potential for translational medicine.",False,0,,True,0

This problem emerges in many transportation and infrastructure networks that are of critical importance to society. We identify two significant shortcomings of present reinforcement learning methods: their exclusive focus on topology to the detriment of spatial characteristics (which are known to influence the growth and density of links), as well as the rapid growth in the action spaces and costs of model training. Our formulation as a deterministic Markov decision process allows us to adopt the Monte Carlo tree search framework, an artificial intelligence decision-time planning method. We propose improvements over the standard upper confidence bounds for trees (UCT) algorithm for this family of problems that addresses their single-agent nature, the trade-off between the cost of edges and their contribution to the objective, and an action space linear in the number of nodes. Our approach yields substantial improvements over UCT for increasing the efficiency and attack resilience of synthetic networks and real-world Internet backbone and metro systems, while using a wall clock time budget similar to other search-based algorithms. We also demonstrate that our approach scales to significantly larger networks than previous reinforcement learning methods, since it does not require training a model.",False,0,,True,0

Here, we use our new population synthesis code, cBHBd, to determine the redshift evolution of the merger rate density and masses of black hole binaries formed in globular clusters. We simulate $\sim 2$ million models to explore the parameter space that is relevant to real clusters and over all mass scales. We show that when uncertainties on the initial cluster mass function and density are properly taken into account, they become the two dominant factors in setting the theoretical error bars on merger rates. Other model parameters (e.g., natal kicks, black hole masses, metallicity) have virtually no effect on the local merger rate density, although they affect the masses of the merging black holes. Modelling the merger rate density as a function of redshift as $R(z)=R_0(1+z)^\kappa$ at $z<2$, and marginalizing over uncertainties, we find: $R_0=7.2^{+21.5}_{-5.5}{\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$ and $\kappa=1.6^{+0.4}_{-0.6}$ ($90\%$ credibility). The rate parameters for binaries that merge inside the clusters are ${R}_{\rm 0,in}=1.6^{+1.9}_{-1.0}{\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$ and $\kappa_{\rm in}=2.3^{+1.3}_{-1.0}$; $\sim 20\%$ of these form as the result of a gravitational-wave capture, implying that eccentric mergers from globular clusters contribute $\lesssim 0.4 \rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ to the local rate. A comparison to the merger rate reported by LIGO-Virgo shows that a scenario in which most of the detected black hole mergers are formed in globular clusters is consistent with current constraints, and requires initial cluster half-mass densities $\gtrsim 10^4 M_\odot \rm pc^{-3}$. Such models also reproduce the inferred primary black hole mass distribution for masses $13-30 M_\odot$, but under-predict the data outside this range.",False,0,,True,0

Numerous methods, including the hybrid TF coordinate and smoothing vertical layers, have been proposed to reduce the advection errors. Advection errors are affected by the directions of velocity fields and the complexity of the terrain. In this study, an unstructured adaptive mesh together with the discontinuous Galerkin finite element method is employed to reduce advection errors over steep terrains. To test the capability of adaptive meshes, five two-dimensional (2D) idealized tests are conducted. Then, the results of adaptive meshes are compared with those of cut-cell and TF meshes. The results show that using adaptive meshes reduces the advection errors by one to two orders of magnitude compared to the cut-cell and TF meshes regardless of variations in velocity directions or terrain complexity. Furthermore, adaptive meshes can reduce the advection errors when the tracer moves tangentially along the terrain surface and allows the terrain to be represented without incurring in severe dispersion. Finally, the computational cost is analyzed. To achieve a given tagging criterion level, the adaptive mesh requires fewer nodes, smaller minimum mesh sizes, less runtime and lower proportion between the node numbers used for resolving the tracer and each wavelength than cut-cell and TF meshes, thus reducing the computational costs.",False,0,,True,0

But by 1963, British film companies had ceased production of second features for a number of reasons: they were no longer commercially viable due to rising production costs, their quality was much maligned at a time when American companies were producing higher budget, glossier fare, and by the early 1960s television was producing the kinds of low-budget crime dramas favoured by ‘B’ movie producers. However, the passing of the ‘B’ movie was mourned by some, who had seen it as a potential training ground for talent in an indigenous industry which offered few routes in for film-makers. Some cinema exhibitors also worried about how the decline of the ‘B’s would affect the staple cinema double bill. This article will examine the events which led to the decline of the British ‘B’ movie in the early 1960s, arguing that the demise of this production mode can shed light on the structure of the British film industry in the 1960s, as well as highlighting some of the challenges which faced film producers throughout the decade.",False,0,,True,0

Enzymes specialised for this task are known as ring nucleases, but are limited in their distribution. Here, we demonstrate that the widespread CRISPR associated protein Csx3, previously described as an RNA deadenylase, is a ring nuclease that rapidly degrades cyclic tetra-adenylate (cA4).

This ensures that our description of inflation is both conformally and reparameterization covariant. Our formulation gives rise to extensions of the usual Hubble and potential slow-roll parameters to generalized fully frame-covariant forms, which allow us to provide manifestly frame-invariant predictions for cosmological observables, such as the tensor-to-scalar ratio r, the spectral indices nR and nT, their runnings αR and αT, the non-Gaussianity parameter fNL, and the isocurvature fraction βiso. We examine the role of the field space curvature in the generation and transfer of isocurvature modes, and we investigate the effect of boundary conditions for the scalar fields at the end of inflation on the observable inflationary quantities. We explore the stability of the trajectories with respect to the boundary conditions by using a suitable sensitivity parameter. To illustrate our approach, we first analyze a simple minimal two-field scenario before studying a more realistic nonminimal model inspired by Higgs inflation. We find that isocurvature effects are greatly enhanced in the latter scenario and must be taken into account for certain values in the parameter space such that the model is properly normalized to the observed scalar power spectrum PR. Finally, we outline how our frame-covariant approach may be extended beyond the tree-level approximation through the Vilkovisky–De Witt formalism, which we generalize to take into account conformal transformations, thereby leading to a fully frame-invariant effective action at the one-loop level.",False,0,,True,1

However, progress has been limited thus far due to differences in approaches between psychologists and behavioral ecologists. Although the former tend to use controlled experiments to pinpoint precise cognitive mechanisms, these experiments often lack ecological validity. In contrast, behavioral ecologists seek to understand the adaptive function of cooperative behavior of animals in the wild but typically neglect the underlying psychological mechanisms. Here we appraise and integrate evidence from these two approaches to understand the potential cognitive solutions to four fundamental challenges that animals face during cooperative interactions under natural conditions: (1) when to cooperate; (2) with whom to cooperate; (3) what to do in cooperative interactions; (4) how much to contribute to cooperation. We argue that an ecologically motivated approach is critical to understanding the psychological mechanisms of cooperation and how these mechanisms evolve.",False,0,,True,0

Here, for the first time, the morphology of a sulfur cathode was visualized in 3D as a function of state of charge at high temporal and spatial resolution. While elemental sulfur was originally well-dispersed throughout the uncycled cathode, subsequent charging resulted in the formation of sulfur clusters along preferred orthogonal orientations in the cathode. The electrical conductivity of the cathode was found not to be rate-limiting, suggesting the need to optimize the loading of conductive carbon additives. The carbon and binder domain and surrounding bulk pore phase were visualized in the in situ cell, and contrast changes within both phases were successfully extracted.

Novel technology-based agricultural production systems such as controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) are a way to reduce the impact of climatic variation and pests that harm current global crop production and ensure consistent crop development. These systems often use artificial lighting and soilless mediums to produce crops. This meta-analysis has investigated the key influencing factors on crop production within these systems, using previous studies on lettuce (the most cultivated crop in these systems) to understand what affects yield within CEA. This analysis has found that on average, CEA systems yield twice that of field-based agriculture (3.68 kg m−2 vs. 1.88 kg m−2), with the most influencing factors being the variety of cultivars grown, the season, the nutrient delivery method, and the lighting type. The cultivation time for this study was 40 days, with 94% of papers having trial periods of 70 days or less, much lower than field-based agriculture (60–120 days). Vertical farming (stacked vertical CEA cultivation) studies were found to especially drive up yield per area (6.88 kg m−2). The results of this meta-analysis are useful for starting to understand the key influencing factors on CEA growth and highlight the breadth of research ongoing in the CEA industry.",False,0,,True,0

We calculate the molecular abundances by post-processing the simulations with an equilibrium chemistry solver while accounting for the effects of local sources, and determine the emergent CO(1–0) emission using a line radiative transfer code. We find that the results depend strongly on the shielding length assumed, which, in our models, sets the attenuation of the incident UV radiation field. At the resolution of these simulations, commonly used choices for the shielding length, such as the Jeans length, result in CO abundances that are too high at a given H2 abundance. We find that a model with a distribution of shielding lengths, which has a median shielding length of ∼3 pc in cold gas (T &amp;lt; 300 K) for both CO and H2, is able to reproduce both the observed CO(1–0) luminosity and inferred CO-to-H2 conversion factor at a given star formation rate compared with observations. We suggest that this short shielding length can be thought of as a subgrid model, which controls the amount of radiation that penetrates giant molecular clouds.",False,0,,True,0

However, due to the time consuming nature of manually generating these annotations, they tend to be scarce and limited to small subsets of data. This work explores a novel framework to propagate voxel-wise annotations between morphologically dissimilar images by diffusing and mapping the available examples through intermediate steps. A spatially-variant graph structure connecting morphologically similar subjects is introduced over a database of images, enabling the gradual diffusion of information to all the subjects, even in the presence of large-scale morphological variability. We illustrate the utility of the proposed framework on two example applications: brain parcellation using categorical labels and tissue segmentation using probabilistic features. The application of the proposed method to categorical label fusion showed highly statistically significant improvements when compared to state-of-the-art methodologies. Significant improvements were also observed when applying the proposed framework to probabilistic tissue segmentation of both synthetic and real data, mainly in the presence of large morphological variability.",False,0,,True,0

We describe a platform technology approach to detect in situ enzyme activity and observe drug inhibition in the distal human lung using a combination of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) optical reporters, fibered confocal fluorescence microscopy (FCFM), and a bespoke delivery device. Introduction . The development of new therapeutic agents is hindered by the lack of in vivo in situ experimental methodologies that can rapidly evaluate the biological activity or drug-target engagement in patients. Methods . We optimised a novel highly quenched optical molecular reporter of enzyme activity (FIB One) and developed a translational pathway for in-human assessment. Results . We demonstrate the specificity for matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) 2, 9, and 13 and probe dequenching within physiological levels of MMPs and feasibility of imaging within whole lung models in preclinical settings. Subsequently, in a first-in-human exploratory experimental medicine study of patients with fibroproliferative lung disease, we demonstrate, through FCFM, the MMP activity in the alveolar space measured through FIB One fluorescence increase (with pharmacological inhibition).

Therefore, tight regulation of inositol polyphosphate metabolism is essential for proper cell physiology. Here, we describe an early-onset neurodegenerative syndrome caused by loss-of-function mutations in the multiple inositol-polyphosphate phosphatase 1 gene ( MINPP1 ). Patients are found to have a distinct type of Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia with typical basal ganglia involvement on neuroimaging. We find that patient-derived and genome edited MINPP1 −/− induced stem cells exhibit an inefficient neuronal differentiation combined with an increased cell death. MINPP1 deficiency results in an intracellular imbalance of the inositol polyphosphate metabolism. This metabolic defect is characterized by an accumulation of highly phosphorylated inositols, mostly inositol hexakisphosphate (IP 6 ), detected in HEK293 cells, fibroblasts, iPSCs and differentiating neurons lacking MINPP1. In mutant cells, higher IP 6 level is expected to be associated with an increased chelation of intracellular cations, such as iron or calcium, resulting in decreased levels of available ions. These data suggest the involvement of IP 6 -mediated chelation on Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia disease pathology and thereby highlight the critical role of MINPP1 in the regulation of human brain development and homeostasis.",False,0,,True,0

Secondary DNA structures formed by STRs are believed to play an important role in expansion, while the presence of nucleotide interruptions within the pure repeat sequence is known to delay the onset and progression of disease. We have used two single-molecule fluorescence techniques to analyse the structure and dynamics of DNA three-way junctions (3WJs) containing CAG repeat hairpin slipouts, with and without a single CAA interrupt. For a 3WJ with a (CAG)10 slipout, the CAA interrupt is preferentially located in the hairpin loop, and the branch migration dynamics are 4-fold slower than for the 3WJ with a pure (CAG)10, and 3-fold slower than a 3WJ with a pure (CAG)40 repeat. The (CAG)11 3WJ with CAA interrupt adopts a conformation that places the interrupt in or near the hairpin loop, with similar dynamics to the pure (CAG)10 and (CAG)11 3WJs. We have shown that changing a single nucleotide (G to A) in a pure repeat can have a large impact on 3WJ structure and dynamics, which may be important for the protective role of interrupts in repeat expansion diseases.",False,0,,True,0

By contrast, the formation of solid solutions in molecular crystals has been overlooked despite its long-standing prevalence in the analogous field of inorganic crystals. Wilfully forgotten, crystalline molecular solid solutions may be very common in our world since molecular compounds are rarely produced with 100% purity, and impurities able to form solid solutions are difficult to reject via recrystallization. Given the importance of both polymorphism and solid solutions in molecular crystals, we share here some tips, tricks, and observations to aid in their understanding. First, we propose a nomenclature system fit for the description of molecular crystalline solid solutions capable of polymorphism (tips).

It plays an important role in the excited state decay dynamics of many molecular systems and not just those containing heavy elements. In the simplest case, ISC is driven by direct spin-orbit coupling between two states of different multiplicities. This coupling is usually assumed to remain unchanged by vibrational motion. It is also often presumed that spin-allowed radiationless transitions, i.e. internal conversion, and the nonadiabatic coupling that drives them, can be considered separately from ISC and spin-orbit coupling owing to the vastly different time scales upon which these processes are assumed to occur. However, these assumptions are too restrictive. Indeed, the strong mixing brought about by the simultaneous presence of nonadiabatic and spin-orbit coupling means that often the spin, electronic, and vibrational dynamics cannot be described independently. Instead of considering a simple ladder of states, as depicted in a Jablonski diagram, one must consider the more complicated spin-vibronic levels. Despite the basic ideas being outlined in the 1960s, it is only with the advent of high-level theory and femtosecond spectroscopy that the importance of the spin-vibronic mechanism for ISC in both fundamental as well as applied research fields has been revealed with significant impact across chemistry, physics, and biology. In this review article, we present the theory and fundamental principles of the spin-vibronic mechanism for ISC. This is followed by empirical rules to estimate the rate of ISC within this regime. The most recent developments in experimental techniques, theoretical methods, and models for the spin-vibronic mechanism are discussed. These concepts are subsequently illustrated with examples, including the ISC mechanisms in transition metal complexes, small organic molecules, and organic chromophores.",False,0,,True,0

It also raises the potential of harnessing genomic selection for genetic improvement in oyster breeding programmes. The aim of this study was to characterise a breeding population of Australian oysters through genotyping and analysis of 18 027 SNPs, followed by comparison with genotypes of oyster sampled from Europe and Asia. This revealed that the Australian populations had similar population diversity (HE ) to oysters from New Zealand, the British Isles, France and Japan. Population divergence was assessed using PCA of genetic distance and revealed that Australian oysters were distinct from all other populations tested. Australian Pacific oysters originate from planned introductions sourced from three Japanese populations. Approximately 95% of these introductions were from geographically, and potentially genetically, distinct populations from the Nagasaki oysters assessed in this study. Finally, in preparation for the application of genomic selection in oyster breeding programmes, the strength of LD was evaluated and subsets of loci were tested for their ability to accurately infer relationships. Weak LD was observed on average; however, SNP subsets were shown to accurately reconstitute a genomic relationship matrix constructed using all loci. This suggests that low-density SNP panels may have utility in the Australian population tested, and the findings represent an important first step towards the design and implementation of genomic approaches for applied breeding in Pacific oysters.",False,0,,True,0

These avalanches soften the underlying minerals and play a key role as indicators for the prediction of geo-engineering disasters, such as mining collapses, rock outbursts caused by high ground stress, and man-made quakes by fracking. Compressed sandstone is a model material for the investigation of avalanches. The avalanche energies, amplitudes, and waiting times show the probability distributions that allow us to distinguish between three compression stages; namely, (I) pre-failure, (II) correlated failure, and (III) post-failure. The energy of stage I and stage II is power-law distributed and scale invariant, while post-failure experiments show power laws with high exponential damping (friction). The scaling behavior is close to the predictions of a mean-field (MF) model (stage II) and a force-integrated mean-field model (stage I).

In CSA, local farmers and households share the costs and products of farming, allowing them to organise food provision non-commercially around short supply chains. While this may prefigure alternatives to the dominant food system, CSA is considered limited in regard to its scalability and accessibility. While these shortcomings apply to individual CSAs, we know little about whether multi-CSA networks can tackle them by expanding and institutionalising their practices at scale. This paper alleviates this blind spot by investigating local CSA networks in Wales and Germany through a lens of ‘food movement networks’, identifying their scaling practices and encountered challenges. It draws on semi-structured interviews with CSA actors and observations at network gatherings. The paper shows that local collaboration enables CSAs to integrate their supply chains (scaling out), engage their communities (scaling deep), and participate in food councils (scaling up), while further networking at regional level helps new initiatives start up. It also reveals competitive tensions between neighbouring CSAs, which constitutes a hitherto unknown challenge to CSA’s potential scalability.",False,0,,True,0

This paper investigates the errors that can occur with Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) and the potential of using Advanced SEA (ASEA) to improve predictions. The focus is on the low- and mid-frequency range where plates only support local modes with low mode counts and the in situ modal overlap is relatively high. To increase the computational efficiency when using ASEA on large systems, a beam tracing method is introduced which groups together all rays with the same heading into a single beam. Based on a diffuse field on the source plate, numerical experiments are used to determine the angular distribution of incident power on receiver plate edges on linear and cuboid box-like structures. These show that on receiver plates which do not share a boundary with the source plate, the angular distribution on the receiver plate boundaries differs significantly from a diffuse field. SEA and ASEA predictions are assessed through comparison with finite element models. With rain-on-the-roof excitation on the source plate, the results show that compared to SEA, ASEA provides significantly better estimates of the receiver plate energy, but only where there are at least one or two bending modes in each one-third octave band. Whilst ASEA provides better accuracy than SEA, discrepancies still exist which become more apparent when the direct propagation path crosses more than three nominally identical structural junctions.",False,0,,True,0

Therefore, studying healthy apolipoprotein E genotyped individuals offers an opportunity to investigate the earliest changes in brain measures that may signal the presence of disease-related processes. For example, subtle changes in functional magnetic resonance imaging functional connectivity, particularly within the default mode network, have been described when comparing healthy ε4 carriers to ε3 carriers. Similarly, very mild impairments of episodic memory have also been documented in healthy apolipoprotein E ε4 carriers. Here, we use a naturalistic activity (movie watching), and a marker of episodic memory encoding (transient changes in functional magnetic resonance imaging activity and functional connectivity around so-called ‘event boundaries’), to investigate potential phenotype differences associated with the apolipoprotein E ε4 genotype in a large sample of healthy adults. Using Bayes factor analyses, we found strong evidence against existence of differences associated with apolipoprotein E allelic status. Similarly, we did not find apolipoprotein E-associated differences when we ran exploratory analyses examining: functional system segregation across the whole brain, and connectivity within the default mode network. We conclude that apolipoprotein E genotype has little or no effect on how ongoing experiences are processed in healthy adults. The mild phenotype differences observed in some studies may reflect early effects of Alzheimer’s disease–related pathology in apolipoprotein E ε4 carriers.",False,0,,True,0

Here a full MRI compatible virtual reality (VR) system is described and tested with the aim of creating a radically different experience. Potential benefits could accrue from the strong sense of immersion that can be created with VR, which could create sense experiences designed to avoid the perception of being enclosed and could also provide new modes of diversion and interaction that could make even lengthy MRI examinations much less challenging. Most current VR systems rely on head mounted displays combined with head motion tracking to achieve and maintain a visceral sense of a tangible virtual world, but this technology and approach encourages physical motion, which would be unacceptable and could be physically incompatible for MRI. The proposed VR system uses gaze tracking to control and interact with a virtual world. MRI compatible cameras are used to allow real time eye tracking and robust gaze tracking is achieved through an adaptive calibration strategy in which each successive VR interaction initiated by the subject updates the gaze estimation model. A dedicated VR framework has been developed including a rich virtual world and gaze-controlled game content. To aid in achieving immersive experiences physical sensations, including noise, vibration and proprioception associated with patient table movements, have been made congruent with the presented virtual scene. A live video link allows subject-carer interaction, projecting a supportive presence into the virtual world.",False,0,,True,0

An understanding of the ecological, life-history and geographic variables that predict this intra- and interspecific variation can guide our projections of how populations and species are likely to respond to future climate change. Here, we conduct phylogenetic meta-analyses addressing slope estimates of the timing of avian spring migration regressed on (i) year and (ii) temperature, representing a total of 413 species across five continents. We take into account slope estimation error and examine phylogenetic, ecological and geographic predictors of intra- and interspecific variation. We confirm earlier findings that on average birds have significantly advanced their spring migration time by 2·1 days per decade and 1·2 days °C-1 . We find that over time and in response to warmer spring conditions, short-distance migrants have advanced spring migratory phenology by more than long-distance migrants. We also find that larger bodied species show greater advance over time compared to smaller bodied species. Our results did not reveal any evidence that interspecific variation in migration response is predictable on the basis of species' habitat or diet. We detected a substantial phylogenetic signal in migration time in response to both year and temperature, suggesting that some of the shifts in migratory phenological response to climate are predictable on the basis of phylogeny. However, we estimate high levels of species and spatial variance relative to phylogenetic variance, which is consistent with plasticity in response to climate evolving fairly rapidly and being more influenced by adaptation to current local climate than by common descent. On average, avian spring migration times have advanced over time and as spring has become warmer. While we are able to identify predictors that explain some of the true among-species variation in response, substantial intra- and interspecific variation in migratory response remains to be explained.",False,0,,True,1

During the heterogeneous and multiphase reactions of viscous organic aerosol particles, it is necessary to consider the interplay of numerous mass transfer processes and how they are impacted by viscosity, including the partitioning kinetics of semi-volatile organic reactants, water and oxidants. To constrain kinetic models of the heterogeneous chemistry, measurements must provide information on as many observables as possible. Here, the ozonolysis of maleic acid (MA) in ternary aerosol particles containing water and sucrose is used as a model system. By varying the mass ratio of sucrose to MA and by performing reactions over a wide range of relative humidity, direct measurements show that the viscosity of the particle can be varied over 7 orders of magnitude. Measurements of the volatilisation kinetics of MA show that this range in viscosity leads to a suppression in the effective vapour pressure of MA of 3-4 orders of magnitude. The inferred values of the diffusion coefficient of MA in the particle phase closely mirror the expected change in diffusion coefficient from the Stokes-Einstein equation and the change in viscosity. The kinetics of ozonolysis show a similar dependence on particle viscosity that can be further investigated using the kinetic multi-layer model of aerosol surface and bulk chemistry (KM-SUB). Two scenarios, one constraining the diffusion coefficients for MA to those expected based on the Stokes-Einstein equation and the other including the diffusion coefficients as a fit parameter, yield similarly adequate representations of the ozonolysis kinetics, as inferred from the experimental decay in the signature of the vinylic C-H stretching vibration of MA. However, these two scenarios provide very different parameterisations of the compositional dependence of the diffusion coefficients of ozone within the condensed phase, yielding qualitatively different time-dependent internal concentration profiles. We suggest that this highlights the importance of providing additional experimental observables (e.g. particle size, heterogeneity in composition) if measurements and models are to be universally reconciled.",False,0,,True,0

Such networks can exhibit subtle or unpredictable task responses which can pass undetected by conventional general linear modelling (GLM). Additionally, the metabolic demand of these networks in response to stimulation remains incompletely understood. Here, we recorded concurrent BOLD and CBF measurements during median nerve stimulation (MNS) and compared GLM analysis with independent component analysis (ICA) for identifying the spatial, temporal and metabolic properties of responses in the primary sensorimotor cortex (S1/M1), and in the default mode (DMN) and fronto-parietal (FPN) networks. Excellent spatial and temporal agreement was observed between the positive BOLD and CBF responses to MNS detected by GLM and ICA in contralateral S1/M1. Values of the change in cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (Δ%CMRO2) and the Δ%CMRO2/Δ%CBF coupling ratio were highly comparable when using either GLM analysis or ICA to extract the contralateral S1/M1 responses, validating the use of ICA for estimating changes in CMRO2. ICA identified DMN and FPN network activity that was not detected by GLM analysis. Using ICA, spatially coincident increases/decreases in both BOLD and CBF signals to MNS were found in the FPN/DMN respectively. Calculation of CMRO2 changes in these networks during MNS showed that the Δ%CMRO2/Δ%CBF ratio is comparable between the FPN and S1/M1 but is larger in the DMN than in the FPN, assuming an equal value of the parameter M in the DMN, FPN and S1/M1. This work suggests that metabolism-flow coupling may differ between these two fundamental brain networks, which could originate from differences between task-positive and task-negative fMRI responses, but might also be due to intrinsic differences between the two networks.",False,0,,True,0

One classic example of differential allocation is the relative investment into aboveground vs belowground organs, captured by the root : shoot ratio (R : S; Cairns et al., 1997). Optimal partitioning theory suggests that plants allocate more resources to the organ that acquires the most limiting resource (Reynolds & Thornley, 1982; Johnson & Thornley, 1987). Accordingly, plants would allocate more carbon to roots if the limiting resources are belowground, that is water and nutrients, and would allocate more carbon aboveground when the limiting resource is light or CO2. This theory has been supported by recent research showing that the R : S of an individual plant is modulated by environmental factors (Poorter et al., 2012; Fatichi et al., 2014). However, understanding the mechanisms underpinning plant allocation and its response to environmental factors is an active field of research (Delpierre et al., 2016; Paul et al., 2016), and it is likely that plant size and species composition have an effect on R : S. Accounting for these sources of variation is an important challenge for modelling (Franklin et al., 2012). The hypothesis that aridity controls R : S is supported by experiments on tree seedlings, which report higher R : S values in response to simulated drought treatments (Lambers et al., 2008; Poorter et al., 2012). This hypothesis is also consistent with the observation that trees in arid environments tend to allocate proportionally more biomass to roots, which may improve access to soil water (Nepstad et al., 1994) and act as a protected reservoir of stored carbohydrates to facilitate rapid regrowth following disturbances such as fire that are common in arid regions (Ryan et al., 2011). However, previous meta-analyses have led to contradictory results regarding the causes of stand-level variation in R : S. Mokany et al. (2006) found precipitation was the main control on R : S values; by contrast, Reich et al. (2014) suggested that temperature was the main driver, with R : S largely unrelated to aridity. Yet, previous studies used either data from soil cores (Reich et al., 2014), or a limited amount of data on root biomass from individually excavated trees (Cairns et al., 1997; Mokany et al., 2006), making it impossible to explore individual patterns of R : S variation in response to tree size and environmental conditions. Using the largest global dataset of its kind, here we provide the first analysis of global patterns of variation in individual-tree R : S. We hypothesized that individual R : S varies with environmental conditions, namely climate and management type, and is also determined by intrinsic factors, namely tree size and species. We also aimed to rank the relative contribution of these factors to R : S variation. The global dataset of individual R : S values was compiled from whole-tree harvesting studies (Supporting Information Notes S1 and Fig. S1), the BAAD among them (Falster et al., 2015) [correction added after online publication 23 October 2017: the reference Falster et al. (2015) has been inserted here and in the References section]. The dataset encompasses 409 sites and a total of 3416 trees of 212 species with oven dry weight measurements of both aboveground and belowground biomass, from which we computed the R : S (Fig. 1). The destructively-sampled trees included in the database had diameter-at-breast height (DBH) values ranging from 0.6 to 128 cm (more details in Fig. S1). We fitted linear regression models, using the natural logarithm of R : S, loge(R : S), as the response variable to reduce heteroscedasticity. The explanatory variables that we analysed were tree size, tree species, wood specific gravity, phenology (evergreen, deciduous), and clade (gymnosperm, dicot angiosperm or monocot angiosperm, i.e. palm). Additional factors in the models were bioclimatic region (tropical dry, tropical wet, non-tropical), temperature, precipitation, whether the tree was growing in a natural forest or plantation, and climatic water deficit (MWD, for mean water deficit, in mm yr−1), which is the deficit between monthly rainfall and potential evapotranspiration (Aragão et al., 2007). Additional details about the explanatory variables and methods are in Methods S1. We carried out a stepwise regression analysis, retaining the variables significant at 95%, and selected the best model based on Akaike information criterion (AIC) values. The conditional and marginal variances, R 2 GLMM values, for the final model and variances for each component were calculated using the method proposed by Nakagawa & Schielzeth (2013). All statistical analyses were conducted in R (code reproduced in Notes S2). where DBH is in centimetres, MWD is in millimetres, plantation is a binary 1/0 dummy variable and Species is a species specific random term. The most important factor explaining global tree R : S values was tree size: DBH and DBH2 jointly accounted for 33% of the variance. Mean R : S values decreased with tree size for trees with DBH up to 1 m. For instance, saplings < 2 cm DBH had a mean R : S of 0.43, while trees with DBH 25–30 cm had a value of 0.28. For trees with DBH larger than 1 m, R : S did not vary much (but the sample size for these was small, only 42 trees). Saplings and small trees presumably invest more biomass belowground to take up nutrients and water for fast growth and survival (Poorter et al., 2012). The decline in R : S with increasing DBH is also consistent with the fact that as trees age, and DBH increases, nonconductive xylem accumulates disproportionately in aboveground tree parts. MWD accounted for 17% of the variance, and R : S declined with decreasing MWD (Fig. 2). This suggests that plants experiencing water shortage allocate more biomass belowground, in agreement with Mokany et al. (2006) and observations from experiments (Hodge, 2004; Lambers et al., 2008; Poorter et al., 2012), but not with Reich et al. (2014). When MWD was included in the model, both precipitation and temperature became nonsignificant. MWD also explained more variance than precipitation or temperature when these variables were fitted separately in single-factor models (Methods S1). Importantly, the relationship between R : S and both DBH and MWD was nonlinear, as has been observed previously (Mugasha et al., 2013). Many of the tested effects were not statistically significant, presumably because in some instances large variances precluded detection of true differences, and in others because of the absence of an effect. Our analysis does suggest that, after accounting for MWD, variation in R : S did not differ across bioclimatic regions. We detected no correlation or significant interaction between tree size and MWD, which suggests that the effects of these two variables are independent (Methods S1). This is an interesting contrast with the findings of Bennett et al. (2015), who determined that larger trees are more vulnerable to drought than smaller trees: the influence of chronic water deficit (as expressed by MWD) on R : S apparently does not translate to ability to respond to episodic drought. Species identity accounted for only 11% of the variance in R : S, and contrary to previous studies (Mokany et al., 2006; Reich et al., 2014), groupings of species by phenology or clade did not explain any additional variation in R : S (Fig. S2), except that monocotyledons (palms) invest comparatively less biomass in roots. Species can have widely different root architectures (Lynch, 1995), therefore differences in R : S values across species are not surprising. After accounting for species, wood specific gravity was not a significant predictor of R : S. Finally, trees in plantations had lower R : S than trees in natural forests (Fig. S2b), although this effect explained only 2% of the variance in R : S. Plantations are sometimes fertilized, which may result in lower biomass allocation in belowground tissues in response to the greater nutrient availability. Moreover, species in plantations are typically fast-growing and selected for their capacity to produce aboveground biomass quickly. Finally, plantation trees may be more sheltered and the structural support of the roots is less necessary. The remaining 38% of variance that was unexplained may be due in part to soil fertility, which is known to influence R : S (Reynolds & D'Antonio, 1996; Poorter et al., 2012). Other possible sources of variance, not considered due to a lack of data here, include differences in micro-topography, soil properties, particular individual conditions like resprouting, and community structure. Further, differences in methodology for collecting root data (see Fig. S1(2.3)) among studies may account for some of the variance. The main novel finding of this study is that globally, variation in individual tree R : S is largely dominated by two effects: tree size and MWD, which largely support our hypothesis. The increase in R : S in response to increasing climatic water deficit occurs independently of the size dependence in R : S, which supports the hypothesis that moisture availability drives global variation in R : S. With greater aridity, trees invest comparatively more resources to acquire soil water as it becomes a more limiting resource for growth and survival, and to provide a belowground reservoir of stored carbon for rapid regrowth following disturbance. Plasticity in R : S has major implications for our understanding of the contribution of vegetation to the global carbon cycle and responses to climatic change. Some parts of the globe are predicted to experience drying trends, including longer dry seasons, and an increase in the frequency of extreme events and disturbances, while other regions may become wetter or less seasonal (Moss et al., 2010; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2014). Our new results suggest that any change in water deficit, or in the relative abundance of smaller trees, may result in shifts in biomass allocation, with far-reaching consequences for the global carbon budget.

The project aimed to address two issues: (1) how does a temperate shelf sea sustain an annual net drawdown and export of atmospheric CO2 without running out of inorganic nutrients, and (2) what uncertainties in processes or parameterisations within current ecosystem models can be reduced by a coordinated, multi-disciplinary observational programme covering the full seasonal cycle? Working with partners across Europe, the net annual drawdown of atmospheric CO2 over the entire northwest European shelf was confirmed. This demonstrated the context and impetus for a 17-month process study in the Celtic Sea, using a long-term mooring array and several research cruises, addressing shelf sea physics, inorganic and organic nutrient and carbon cycling, and bacterial, phytoplankton and zooplankton roles and dynamics. It was clear from the physics that all the carbon absorbed through the sea surface over one year was not exported to the open ocean. Physical transports were too weak and too slow to transport all the carbon-laden water over a wide shelf sea to the shelf edge within one year. The shelf sea must therefore be able to store carbon in a form that prevents release back to the atmosphere for a timescale that is sufficient to allow more episodic (timescales >1 year) exchange events to both remove the excess carbon and top-up the shelf pool of inorganic nutrients. The results presented in this special issue illustrate the likely key role of recalcitrant dissolved organic carbon in storing carbon on the shelf and highlight the need for longer-term measurements or monitoring to understand the nature and timing of potentially large but infrequent exchange events between the shelf and open ocean.",False,0,,True,0

Magnetron-sputtered coatings have been structurally compared to their compositionally equivalent melt-quenched bulk glass counterparts. The coatings were found to have structurally variable surfaces to melt-quenched glass such that the respective bridging oxygen to nonbridging oxygen bonds were 34.2% to 65.8% versus 20.5% to 79.5%, forming metaphosphate (PO3)− (Q2) versus less soluble (P2O7)4– (Q1) and (PO4)3– (Q0), respectively. This factor led to highly soluble coatings, exhibiting a t1/2 degradation dependence in the first 2 h in distilled water, followed by a more characteristic linear profile because the subsequent layers were less soluble. Degradation was observed to preferentially occur, forming voids characteristic of pitting corrosion, which was confirmed by the use of a focused ion beam. Coating degradation in PBS precipitated a (PO3)− metaphosphate, an X-ray amorphous layer, which remained adherent to the substrate and seemingly formed a protective diffusion barrier, which inhibited further coating degradation. The implications are that while compositionally similar, sputter-deposited coatings and melt-quenched glasses are structurally dissimilar, most notably, with regard to the surface layer. This factor has been attributed to surface etching of the as-deposited coating layer during deposition and variation in the thermal history between the processes of magnetron sputtering and melt quenching.",False,0,,True,0

Objective Investigate associations of maternal glycemia with placental inositol content, determine glucose effects on placental expression of inositol enzymes and transporters, and examine relations with birthweight. Design and Participants Case-control study of placentae from term singleton pregnancies (GDM n = 24, non-GDM n = 26), and culture of another 9 placentae in different concentrations of glucose and myo-inositol for 48 hours. Main Outcome Measures Placental inositol was quantified by the Megazyme assay. Relative expression of enzymes involved in myo-inositol metabolism and plasma membrane inositol transport was determined by quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting. Linear regression analyses were adjusted for maternal age, body mass index, ethnicity, gestational age, and sex. Results Placental inositol content was 17% lower in GDM compared with non-GDM. Higher maternal mid-gestation glycemia were associated with lower placental inositol. Increasing fasting glycemia was associated with lower protein levels of the myo-inositol synthesis enzyme, IMPA1, and the inositol transporters, SLC5A11 and SLC2A13, the expression of which also correlated with placental inositol content. In vitro, higher glucose concentrations reduced IMPA1 and SLC5A11 mRNA expression. Increasing fasting glycemia positively associated with customized birthweight percentile as expected in cases with low placental inositol, but this association was attenuated with high placental inositol. Conclusion Glycemia-induced dysregulation of placental inositol synthesis and transport may be implicated in reduced placental inositol content in GDM, and this may in turn be permissive to accelerated fetal growth.",False,0,,True,1

Recently, cord blood DNA methylation data has been used to predict gestational age. The discrepancy between gestational age predicted from DNA methylation and determined by ultrasound or last menstrual period is known as gestational age acceleration. This study investigated associations of sex, socioeconomic status, parental behaviours and characteristics and birth outcomes with gestational age acceleration.Using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (n = 863), we found that pre-pregnancy maternal overweight and obesity were associated with greater gestational age acceleration (mean difference = 1.6 days, 95% CI 0.7 to 2.6, and 2.9 days, 95% CI 1.3 to 4.4, respectively, compared with a body mass index < 25 kg/m2, p < .001). There was evidence of an association between male sex and greater gestational age acceleration. Greater gestational age acceleration was associated with higher birthweight, birth length and head circumference of the child (mean differences per week higher gestational age acceleration: birthweight 0.1 kg, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.2, p < .001; birth length 0.4 cm, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.7, p < .001; head circumference 0.2 cm, 95% CI 0.1 to - 0.4, p < .001). There was evidence of an association between gestational age acceleration and mode of delivery (assisted versus unassisted delivery, odds ratio = 0.9 per week higher gestational age acceleration, 95% CI 0.7, 1.3 (p = .05); caesarean section versus unassisted delivery, odds ratio = 0.6, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.9 per week higher gestational age acceleration (p = .05)). There was no evidence of association for other parental and perinatal characteristics.The associations of higher maternal body mass index and larger birth size with greater gestational age acceleration may imply that maternal overweight and obesity is associated with more rapid development of the fetus in utero.

It predicts age quite well from 353 CpG sites in the DNA methylation profile in unknown samples and has been used to calculate “age acceleration” in various tissues and environments. Results The model systematically underestimates age in tissues from older people. This is seen in all examined tissues but most strongly in the cerebellum and is consistently observed in multiple datasets. Age acceleration is thus age-dependent, and this can lead to spurious associations. The current literature includes examples of association tests with age acceleration calculated in a wide variety of ways. Conclusions The concept of an epigenetic clock is compelling, but caution should be taken in interpreting associations with age acceleration. Association tests of age acceleration should include age as a covariate.",False,0,,True,0

We determine whether the mean redshift $<z>$ of ten Euclid tomographic redshift bins can be calibrated to the Euclid target uncertainties of $\sigma(<z>)<0.002\,(1+z)$ via cross-correlation, with spectroscopic samples akin to those from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), and Euclid's NISP spectroscopic survey. We construct mock Euclid and spectroscopic galaxy samples from the Flagship simulation and measure small-scale clustering redshifts up to redshift $z<1.8$ with an algorithm that performs well on current galaxy survey data. The clustering measurements are then fitted to two $n(z)$ models: one is the true $n(z)$ with a free mean; the other a Gaussian Process modified to be restricted to non-negative values. We show that $<z>$ is measured in each tomographic redshift bin to an accuracy of order 0.01 or better. By measuring the clustering redshifts on subsets of the full Flagship area, we construct scaling relations that allow us to extrapolate the method performance to larger sky areas than are currently available in the mock. For the full expected Euclid, BOSS, and DESI overlap region of approximately 6000 deg$^{2}$, the uncertainties attainable by clustering redshifts exceeds the Euclid requirement by at least a factor of three for both $n(z)$ models considered, although systematic biases limit the accuracy. Clustering redshifts are an extremely effective method for redshift calibration for Euclid if the sources of systematic biases can be determined and removed, or calibrated-out with sufficiently realistic simulations.

This results in strong chorus acceleration between approximately 2.5 R S and 5.5 R S outside which adiabatic transport may dominate. Strong pitch angle dependence results in butterfly pitch angle distributions that flatten over a few days at 100s keV, tens of days at MeV energies which may explain observations of butterfly distributions of MeV electrons near L=3.

This article develops an alternative framework that explicitly spotlights women’s labour market outcomes rather than policies. Using hierarchical clustering on principal components, it groups 24 industrialized countries by their simultaneous performance across multiple gendered employment outcomes spanning segregation and inequalities in employment participation, intensity, and pay, with further differences by class. The three core ‘worlds’ of welfare (social-democratic, corporatist, liberal) each displays a distinctive pattern of gendered employment outcomes. Only France diverges from expectations, as large gender pay gaps across the educational divide – likely due to fragmented wage-bargaining – place it with Anglophone countries. Nevertheless, the outcome-based clustering fails to support the idea of a homogeneous Mediterranean grouping or a singular Eastern European cluster. Furthermore, results underscore the complexity and idiosyncrasy of gender inequality: while certain groups of countries are ‘better’ overall performers, all have their flaws. Even the Nordics fall behind on some measures of segregation, despite narrow participatory and pay gaps for lower- and high-skilled groups. Accordingly, separately monitoring multiple measures of gender inequality, rather than relying on ‘headline’ indicators or gender equality indices, matters.",False,0,,True,0

Intracellular location and survival of the pathogen were explored using gentamicin survival assays, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy of M. hyopneumoniae 232 labelled with green fluorescent protein (GFP). Following 1 h and 16 h of co-incubation, few viable M. hyopneumoniae were recovered from inside macrophages. Flow cytometric analysis of macrophages incubated with M. hyopneumoniae expressing GFP indicated that the mycoplasmas became associated with macrophages, but were shown to be extracellular when actin-dependent phagocytosis was blocked with cytochalasin D. Confocal microscopy detected GFP-labelled M. hyopneumoniae inside macrophages and the numbers increased modestly with time of incubation. Neither the addition of porcine serum complement or convalescent serum from EP-recovered pigs was able to enhance engulfment of M. hyopneumoniae.

However, increasingly interconnected manufacturing information means progressively more complex systems. Therefore, there is an ever growing need to provide structure in the design and development of such information systems which is the role of a system architecture. So called 'reference architectures' guide the design of system architectures used in particular applications. Reference architectures are models of information functions and their connections that provide a structured template with common terminology. Over the last decades, various reference architectures relevant to digital systems in manufacturing have been proposed. However, industrial applications of these reference architectures are scarce and it is difficult to compare and analyse them due to their various levels of application and different uses. In this study, we review and classify reference architectures used to support digital systems in manufacturing.

Here we construct a skills network based on their co-occurrence in a national level data set of 65 million job postings from the UK spanning 2016 to 2022. We then apply multiscale graph-based community detection to obtain data-driven skill clusters at different levels of resolution that reveal a modular structure across scales. Skill clusters display diverse levels of demand and occupy varying roles within the skills network: some have broad reach across the network (high closeness centrality) while others have higher levels of within-cluster containment, yet with high interconnection across clusters and no skill silos. The skill clusters also display varying levels of semantic similarity, highlighting the difference between co-occurrence in adverts and intrinsic thematic consistency. Clear geographic variation is evident in the demand for each skill cluster across the UK, broadly reflecting the industrial characteristics of each region, e.g., London appears as an outlier as an international hub for finance, education and business. Comparison of data from 2016 and 2022 reveals employers are demanding a broader range of skills over time, with more adverts featuring skills spanning different clusters. We also show that our data-driven clusters differ from expert-authored categorisations of skills, indicating that important relationships between skills are not captured by expert assessment alone.",False,0,,True,1

However, the aurora and associated phenomena can also significantly impact communications, ground‐based infrastructure, and high‐altitude radiation exposure. Forecasting the location of the auroral oval is therefore a key component of space weather forecast operations. A version of the OVATION‐Prime 2013 auroral precipitation model (Newell et al., 2014, https://doi.org/10.1002/2014sw001056 ) was used by the UK Met Office Space Weather Operations Centre (MOSWOC). The operational implementation of the OVATION‐Prime 2013 model at the UK Met Office delivered a 30‐min forecast of the location of the auroral oval and the probability of observing the aurora. Using weather forecast evaluation techniques, we evaluate the ability of the OVATION‐Prime 2013 model forecasts to predict the location and probability of the aurora occurring by comparing the forecasts with auroral boundaries determined from data from the IMAGE satellite between 2000 and 2002. Our analysis shows that the operational model performs well at predicting the location of the auroral oval, with a relative operating characteristic (ROC) score of 0.82. The model performance is reduced in the dayside local time sectors (ROC score = 0.59) and during periods of higher geomagnetic activity (ROC score of 0.55 for Kp = 8).

However, OECTs are often limited by the stability of the channel materials. Here, we systematically investigate the stability of OECT channels under varied operating voltage ranges. We find that OECT materials can be operated with high stability when the voltage range is reduced. We show that repeated full voltage cycling degrades device performance. The results indicate that to maximize stability, OECTs should either be operated in the saturation regime to maximize current gain (transconductance) or in the subthreshold regime to maximize the on/off ratio.

Inversion-recovery experiments reveal different recovery curves for the main peak amplitudes, especially when the conversion of population imbalances to observable coherences is induced by a radio frequency pulse with a small flip angle. Measurements are performed over a range of magnetic fields by using a sample shuttle apparatus. In some cases, the time constant TS for decay of nuclear singlet order is more than 100 times larger than the time constant T1 for the equilibration of longitudinal magnetization. The results are interpreted by a theoretical model incorporating cross-correlated relaxation mechanisms, anisotropic rotational diffusion, and an external random magnetic field.

These adaptations are well described for peripheral tissue, though much less is known about how the energy-expensive brain adapts to food restriction, and how such adaptations differ across the sexes. Here, we examined how food restriction impacts energy usage and function in the primary visual cortex (V1) of adult male and female mice. Molecular analysis and RNA sequencing in V1 revealed that in males, but not in females, food restriction significantly modulated canonical, energy-regulating pathways, including pathways associated waith AMP-activated protein kinase, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, mammalian target of rapamycin, and oxidative phosphorylation. Moreover, we found that in contrast to males, food restriction in females did not significantly affect V1 ATP usage or visual coding precision (assessed by orientation selectivity). Decreased serum leptin is known to be necessary for triggering energy-saving changes in V1 during food restriction. Consistent with this, we found significantly decreased serum leptin in food-restricted males but no significant change in food-restricted females. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that cortical function and energy usage in female mice are more resilient to food restriction than in males. The neocortex, therefore, contributes to sex-specific, energy-saving adaptations in response to food restriction.",False,0,,True,1

Memristors are capable of representing information in an ultra-compact fashion, by storing multiple bits per device. However, certain challenges remain in multi-state memristive circuits and systems design such as device stability and peripheral circuit complexity. In this paper, we review the state of the art of multi-state memristor technologies and their associated CMOS/Memristor circuit design, and discuss the challenges regarding device imperfection factors, modelling, peripheral circuit design and layout. We present measurement results of our in-house fabricated multi-state memristor as an example to further illustrate the feasibility of applying multi-state memristors in CMOS design, and demonstrate their related future applications such as multi-state memristive memories in machine learning, memristive neuromorphic applications, trimming and tuning circuits, etc. In the end, we summarize past and present efforts done in this field and envisage the direction of multi-state memristor related research.",False,0,,True,0

However, the lack of empirical evidence has lead to a debate on whether gravity is a quantum entity. Despite varied proposed probes for quantum gravity, it is fair to say that there are no feasible ideas yet to test its quantum coherent behavior directly in a laboratory experiment. Here, we introduce an idea for such a test based on the principle that two objects cannot be entangled without a quantum mediator. We show that despite the weakness of gravity, the phase evolution induced by the gravitational interaction of two micron size test masses in adjacent matter-wave interferometers can detectably entangle them even when they are placed far apart enough to keep Casimir-Polder forces at bay. We provide a prescription for witnessing this entanglement, which certifies gravity as a quantum coherent mediator, through simple spin correlation measurements.",False,0,,True,0

We report a novel G4‐binding chemotype derived from stiff‐stilbene. Surprisingly however, whilst the ligand induces high stabilization in the potassium form of human telomeric DNA, it causes the unfolding of the same G4 sequence in sodium buffer. This effect can be reversed on demand by irradiation with 400 nm light through deactivation of the ligand by photo‐oxidation. By fuelling the system with the photolabile ligand, the conformation of G4 DNA was switched five times.",False,0,,True,0

No consensus has been reached on which decommissioning option(s) result in optimal environmental and societal outcomes, in part, owing to a paucity of evidence from real-world decommissioning case studies. To address this significant challenge, we asked a worldwide panel of scientists to provide their expert opinion. They were asked to identify and characterise the ecosystem effects of artificial structures in the sea, their causes and consequences, and to identify which, if any, should be retained following decommissioning. Experts considered that most of the pressures driving ecological and societal effects from marine artificial structures (MAS) were of medium severity, occur frequently, and are dependent on spatial scale with local-scale effects of greater magnitude than regional effects. The duration of many effects following decommissioning were considered to be relatively short, in the order of days. Overall, environmental effects of structures were considered marginally undesirable, while societal effects marginally desirable. Experts therefore indicated that any decision to leave MAS in place at end-of-life to be more beneficial to society than the natural environment. However, some individual environmental effects were considered desirable and worthy of retention, especially in certain geographic locations, where structures can support improved trophic linkages, increases in tourism, habitat provision, and population size, and provide stability in population dynamics. The expert analysis consensus that the effects of MAS are both negative and positive for the environment and society, gives no strong support for policy change whether removal or retention is favoured until further empirical evidence is available to justify change to the status quo. The combination of desirable and undesirable effects associated with MAS present a significant challenge for policy- and decision-makers in their justification to implement decommissioning options. Decisions may need to be decided on a case-by-case basis accounting for the trade-off in costs and benefits at a local level.",False,0,,True,0

Among the most important challenges faced by ice flow models is how to represent basal and rheological conditions, which are challenging to obtain from direct observations. A common practice is to use numerical inversions to calculate estimates for the unknown properties, but there are many possible methods and not one standardised approach. As such, every ice flow model has a unique initialisation procedure. Here we compare the outputs of inversions from three different ice flow models, each employing a variant of adjoint-based optimisation to calculate basal sliding coefficients and flow rate factors using the same observed surface velocities and ice thickness distribution. The region we focus on is the Amundsen Sea Embayment in West Antarctica, the subject of much investigation due to rapid changes in the area over recent decades. We find that our inversions produce similar distributions of basal sliding across all models, despite using different techniques, implying that the methods used are highly robust and represent the physical equations without much influence by individual model behaviours. Transferring the products of inversions between models results in time-dependent simulations displaying variability on the order of or lower than existing model intercomparisons. Focusing on contributions to sea level, the highest variability we find in simulations run in the same model with different inversion products is 32 %, over a 40-year period, a difference of 3.67 mm. There is potential for this to be improved with further standardisation of modelling processes, and the lowest variability within a single model is 13 %, or 1.82 mm over 40 years. While the successful transfer of inversion outputs from one model to another requires some extra effort and technical knowledge of the particular models involved, it is certainly possible and could indeed be useful for future intercomparison projects.",False,0,,True,0

We explain the anomalously large band gap widening necessary to maintain transparency in terms of lone-pair stabilization via atomic clustering.

In the present study, two novel heat exchangers were proposed by utilizing triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) structures. i.e. the Gyroid structure and Schwarz-D surface, to enhance heat transfer and improve cycle efficiency. TPMS structures are a class of structures composed of two distinct inter-penetrating volume domains separated by an area-minimizing wall, which have been observed as biological membranes and co-polymer phases. Two heat exchangers along with a reference printed circuit heat exchanger (PCHE) were investigated numerically by computational fluid dynamics simulations when the hot and cold sCO2 fluids pass through them at various Reynolds numbers. Effects of geometrical shapes and Reynolds number on the hydraulic and thermal performances were identified. It was demonstrated that two heat exchangers with TPMS can improve overall thermal performance by 15–100%, and the Nusselt number is raised by 16–120% for a given pumping power in comparison with the PCHE. Hence, heat exchangers with TPMS have a very good potential to enhance sCO2 cycle efficiency.",False,0,,True,0

We found that bacterial strains responded in different ways to stressor mixtures, which could not be predicted simply from their phylogenetic relatedness. Increasingly complex chemical mixtures were both more likely to negatively impact bacterial growth in monoculture and more likely to reveal net interactive effects. A mixed co-culture of strains proved more resilient to increasingly complex mixtures and revealed fewer interactions in the growth response.

A commonly used mean-field ansatz, in which spatial correlations are neglected, predicts a bistable behavior with a sharp shift between low- and high-density states. In contrast one-dimensional matrix product methods reveal these effects to be artifacts of the mean-field approach, with both disappearing once correlations are taken fully into account. Instead, a bunching-antibunching transition emerges. This indicates that alternative approaches should be considered for higher spatial dimensions, where classical simulations are currently infeasible. Thus we propose a circuit QED quantum simulator implementable with current technology to enable an experimental investigation of the model considered.",False,0,,True,0

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of processes that occur near the seawater – sediment interface in altering the Nd isotopic composition of bottom waters. The two major observed processes ""boundary exchange"" and ""benthic flux"" have been suggested as playing an important role in setting water mass compositions, however, more studies are needed to constrain their chemical mechanism and the extent to which these processes set the composition of deep waters. The Antarctic continental margin is an important place to study these processes because Antarctic-sourced waters dominate the Southern Ocean and ventilate the global deep ocean. This study is the first to measure and compare seawater, porewater and sediment data from along the margin of Antarctica to examine the nature of potential boundary processes. We show that a process similar to boundary exchange seems to be occurring within porewaters, modifying porewater chemistry by shifting its Nd isotopic ratios to more radiogenic values without significantly increasing the concentration of dissolved Nd. We hypothesize that this shift results from partial dissolution of radiogenic detrital particles, such as smectite, amphibole and/or volcanic glass, while re-scavenging maintains low Nd concentrations. We infer the existence of benthic flux of porewaters to deep waters by examining chemical gradients in porewaters and show that it is much lower on the Antarctic margin compared to other studies. Benthic flux appears to be slightly higher along the Antarctic Peninsula than in the Bellingshausen Sea due to partial degradation of organic matter and associated dissolution of Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides. Taken together, boundary processes do not significantly change the Nd isotopic composition of Antarctic margin seawater because while the porewaters have an altered Nd isotopic composition the Nd concentration of these porewaters is low compared to other settings.",False,0,,True,0

Solid fuel emissions, including those from biomass burning, are increasing in urban areas across the European Union due to rising energy costs and government incentives to use renewable energy sources for heating. In order to help protect human health as well as to improve air quality and pollution abatement strategies, the sources of combustion aerosols, their contributions, and the processes they undergo need to be better understood. A high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) was therefore deployed at an urban background site between January and February 2012 to investigate solid fuel organic aerosols (SFOA) in London. The variability of SFOA was examined and the factors governing the split between the two SFOA factors derived from Positive Matrix Factorisation (PMF) were assessed. The concentrations of both factors were found to increase during the night and during cold periods, consistent with domestic space heating activities. The split between the two factors is likely governed predominantly by differences in burn conditions where SFOA1 best represents more efficient burns and SFOA2 best represents less efficient burns. The differences in efficiency may be due to burner types or burn phase, for example. Different fuel types and levels of atmospheric processing also likely contribute to the two factors. As the mass spectral profile of SFOA is highly variable, the findings from this study may have implications for improving future source apportionment and factorisation analyses. During the winter, SFOA was found to contribute 38% to the total non-refractory submicron organic aerosol (OA) mass, with similar contributions from both SFOA factors (20% from SFOA1 and 18% from SFOA2). A similar contribution of SFOA was derived for the same period from a compact time-of-flight AMS (cToF-AMS), which measured for a full calendar year at the same site. The seasonality of SFOA was investigated using the year-long data set where concentrations were greatest in the autumn and winter. During the summer, SFOA contributed 11% to the organic fraction, where emissions resulted from different anthropogenic activities such as barbecues and domestic garden wood burning. The significant contribution of SFOA to total organic mass throughout the year suggests that the negative effects on health and air quality, as well as climate, are not just confined to winter as exposure to these aerosols and the associated black carbon can also occur during the summer, which may have significant implications for air-quality policies and mitigation strategies.",False,0,,True,0

Different pastures are characterised by varying opportunities for selective feeding by livestock; agronomically improved, sown swards generally consist of a limited range of plant species whereas longer-term leys and semi-natural grasslands are characterised by a more diverse mixture of plants. In the case of botanically diverse permanent pastures/grazing lands, the dietary preferences of different grazers have a more pronounced effect on the botanical composition of the sward in the longer term. Selection of a dominant species within the sward can give less abundant components a chance to compete, increasing community evenness and species richness. Conversely, the selection of minor components reduces sward compositional heterogeneity and hence plant species richness and evenness. Body size, gut type (foregut vs hindgut fermentation), physiological status (growing, pregnant, lactating), metabolic status (extent of body reserves) and environmental conditions all influence the nutrient requirements of a given animal and related foraging priorities. The diet selected is also strongly influenced by the availability of preferred food items, and their vertical and horizontal distribution within the sward. In general, larger animals, such as cattle and horses, are less selective grazers than smaller animals, such as sheep and goats. They are quicker to switch to consuming less-preferred sward components as the availability of preferred resources declines due to their greater forage demands, and as a result can be very effective in controlling competitive plant species consistently avoided by more selective grazers. As a result, low-intensity mixed grazing of cattle and sheep has been shown to improve the diversity and abundance of a range of taxa within grazed ecosystems. Mixed/co-species grazing with different animals exploiting different grassland resources is also associated with increased pasture use efficiency in terms of the use of different sward components and related improvements in nutritional value. In situations where cattle are not available, for example if they are not considered commercially viable, alternative species such as goats, ponies or South American camelids may offer an opportunity to diversify income streams and maintain productive and biodiverse pastures/grazing lands. Stocking rate and timing of grazing also have a considerable role in determining the impact of grazing. Regardless of the species grazing or the pasture grazed, grazing systems are dynamic since selective grazing impacts the future availability of sward components and subsequently dietary choices. New technologies under development provide opportunities to monitor plant/animal interactions more closely and in real time, which will in future support active management to deliver targeted biodiversity gains from specific sites.",False,0,,True,0

We find electronic correlations to be moderately enhanced by oxygen admixture.

Hence, both play an equally important role in reducing the conductivity and stabilizing the geodynamo. We also explain the reduction of Lorenz ratio in core matter.

This poses a cognitive burden and challenge to users with T1D since this relies on frequent user engagement to maintain tight glucose control. In order to move towards fully automated closed-loop glucose control, we propose an algorithm based on a deep learning framework that performs multitask quantile regression, for both meal detection and carbohydrate estimation. Our proposed method is evaluated in silico on 10 adult subjects from the UVa/Padova simulator with a Bio-inspired Artificial Pancreas (BiAP) control algorithm over a 2 month period. Three different configurations of the AP are evaluated -BiAP without meal announcement (BiAP-NMA), BiAP with meal announcement (BiAP-MA), and BiAP with meal detection (BiAP-MD). We present results showing an improvement of BiAP-MD over BiAP-NMA, demonstrating 144.5 ± 6.8 mg/dL mean blood glucose level (-4.4 mg/dL, p< 0.01) and 77.8 ± 6.3% mean time between 70 and 180 mg/dL (+3.9%, p< 0.001). This improvement in control is realised without a significant increase in mean in hypoglycaemia (+0.1%, p= 0.4). In terms of detection of meals and snacks, the proposed method on average achieves 93% precision and 76% recall with a detection delay time of 38 ± 15 min (92% precision, 92% recall, and 37 min detection time for meals only). Furthermore, BiAP-MD handles hypoglycaemia better than BiAP-MA based on CVGA assessment with fewer control errors (10% vs. 20%). This study suggests that multitask quantile regression can improve the capability of AP systems for postprandial glucose control without increasing hypoglycaemia.",False,0,,True,0

The power and angular dependence of the THz output implicate optical rectification of the 800 nm pump as the mechanism of THz generation. Further characterization finds that, for certain crystal orientations, the angular dependence of THz emission is modulated by phonon resonances attributable to the motion of the methyl-DABCO moiety. At maximum, the THz emission spectrum of MDNI is free from significant phonon resonances, resulting in THz pulses with a temporal width of <900 fs and a peak-to-peak electric field strength of approximately 0.8 kV cm–1─2 orders of magnitude higher than any other reported halide perovskite emitters. Our results point toward metal-free perovskites as a promising new class of THz emitters that brings to bear many of the advantages enjoyed by other halide perovskite materials. In particular, the broad tunability of optoelectronic properties and ease of fabrication of perovskite materials opens up the possibility of further optimizing the THz emission properties within this material class.",False,0,,True,0

This presents a severe challenge, given that many of the involved parameters are poorly constrained. In this paper we focus on the role of nuclear reactions. Combining a theoretical discussion with an analysis connecting to state-of-the-art simulations, we outline multiple arguments that lead to a reactive system being described in terms of a bulk viscosity. The results demonstrate that in order to properly account for nuclear reactions, future simulations must be able to handle different regimes where rather different assumptions/approximations are appropriate.

With the continuous Czochralski crystal growth process it is now possible to produce indium doped silicon substrates with the required doping levels for solar cells. This study aims to understand factors controlling the minority carrier lifetime in such substrates with a view to enabling the quantification of the possible benefits of indium doped material. Experiments are performed using temperature‐dependent Hall effect and injection‐dependent carrier lifetime measurements. The recombination rate is found to vary linearly with the concentration of un‐ionized indium which exists in the sample at room temperature due to indium's relatively deep acceptor level at 0.15 eV from the valence band. Lifetime in indium doped silicon is also shown to degrade rapidly under illumination, but to a level substantially higher than in equivalent boron doped silicon samples. A window of opportunity exists in which the minority carrier lifetime in degraded indium doped silicon is higher than the equivalent boron doped silicon, indicating it may be suitable as the base material for front contact photovoltaic cells.",False,0,,True,0

This paper confirms and extends this agreement by presenting results for a wide selection of contacting materials. Additional measurement techniques are also introduced, to give independent confirmation of parameter identification and improve the robustness of the identification process. The results show that virtually every individual measurement can be fitted accurately by the proposed theoretical model, and that in all cases where rapid wear of the contacting materials was not an issue it was possible to achieve a good global fit to sets of tests at different normal loads and sliding speeds. The evidence suggests that this measurement procedure is able to characterise the dynamic behaviour at a frictional interface up to kiloHertz frequencies, and consequently provide the means to discriminate among, and calibrate, proposed dynamic friction models. Identifying a reliable model could significantly improve the prediction accuracy for friction-induced vibration such as vehicle brake squeal.",False,0,,True,1

We conducted a repeat cross-sectional study of individuals (N: 4480) living in the same areas of west central Scotland in 1997 and 2010. Individuals were asked to complete a questionnaire at both time-points, containing 14 questions relating to neighbourhood perceptions and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).

Overall, area-level mean HADS scores decreased from 1997 to 2010. When adjusted for individual and area-level variables, this decrease did not remain for HADS anxiety. Applying an overall 14-scale neighbourhood perception measure, worsening neighbourhood perceptions were associated with small increases in depression (0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.07) and anxiety (0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.08) scores over time.

However, with the promise of future joint gravitational wave (GW) and GRB observations, we shall be able to examine populations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers rather than on a case-by-case basis. We present an analysis that considers GW triggered BNS events both with and without short GRB counterparts assuming that events without a counterpart were observed off-axis. This allows for Bayes factors to be calculated to compare different jet structure models. We perform model comparison between a Gaussian and power-law apparent jet structure on simulated data to demonstrate that the correct model can be distinguished with a log Bayes factor of &gt;5 after fewer than 100 events. Constraints on the apparent structure jet model parameters are also made. After 25(100) events the angular width of the core of a power-law jet structure can be constrained within a 90% credible interval of width ∼9.1(4.4)°, and the outer beaming angle to be within ∼19.9(8.5)°. Similarly, we show the width of a Gaussian jet structure to be constrained to ∼2.8(1.6)°.",False,0,,True,0

Often, core size is inherently affected by the ligand structure in an unpredictable fashion. Functionalized ligands are commonly introduced using postsynthesis exchange procedures, which can be inefficient and operationally delicate. Here, we report a one-step protocol for preparing monolayer-stabilized AuNPs that is compatible with a wide range of ligand functional groups and also allows for the systematic control of core size. In a single-phase reaction using the mild reducing agent tert-butylamine borane, AuNPs that are compatible with solvents spanning a wide range of polarities from toluene to water can be produced without damaging reactive chemical functionalities within the small-molecule surface-stabilizing ligands. We demonstrate that the rate of reduction, which is easily controlled by adjusting the period over which the reducing agent is added, is a simple parameter that can be used irrespective of the ligand structure to adjust the core size of AuNPs without broadening the size distribution. Core sizes in the range of 2–10 nm can thus be generated. The upper size limit appears to be determined by the nature of each specific ligand/solvent pairing.

However, significant technical challenges in handling and analyzing 3D cell cultures remain, which currently limits their widespread application. Herein, we demonstrate the application of wholly synthetic thermoresponsive block copolymer worms in sheet-based 3D cell culture. These worms form a soft, free-standing gel reversibly at 20–37 °C, which can be rapidly converted into a free-flowing dispersion of spheres on cooling to 5 °C. Functionalization of the worms with disulfide groups was found to be essential for ensuring sufficient mechanical stability of these hydrogels to enable long-term cell culture. These disulfide groups are conveniently introduced via statistical copolymerization of a disulfide-based dimethacrylate under conditions that favor intramolecular cyclization and subsequent thiol/disulfide exchange leads to the formation of reversible covalent bonds between adjacent worms within the gel. This new approach enables cells to be embedded within micrometer-thick slabs of gel with good viability, permits cell culture for at least 12 days, and facilitates recovery of viable cells from the gel simply by incubating the culture in buffer at 4 °C (thus, avoiding the enzymatic degradation required for cell harvesting when using commercial protein-based gels, such as Matrigel).",False,0,,True,0

A number of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have demonstrated robust functional connectivity between the time series of BOLD fluctuations in bilateral dorsal horns and between those in bilateral ventral horns, in line with the functional neuroanatomy of the spinal cord. A necessary step prior to extension to clinical studies is assessing the reliability of such resting-state signals, which we aimed to do here in a group of 45 healthy young adults at the clinically prevalent field strength of 3T. When investigating connectivity in the entire cervical spinal cord, we observed fair to good reliability for dorsal-dorsal and ventral-ventral connectivity, whereas reliability was poor for within- and between-hemicord dorsal-ventral connectivity. Considering how prone spinal cord fMRI is to noise, we extensively investigated the impact of distinct noise sources and made two crucial observations: removal of physiological noise led to a reduction in functional connectivity strength and reliability - due to the removal of stable and participant-specific noise patterns - whereas removal of thermal noise considerably increased the detectability of functional connectivity without a clear influence on reliability. Finally, we also assessed connectivity within spinal cord segments and observed that while the pattern of connectivity was similar to that of whole cervical cord, reliability at the level of single segments was consistently poor. Taken together, our results demonstrate the presence of reliable resting-state functional connectivity in the human spinal cord even after thoroughly accounting for physiological and thermal noise, but at the same time urge caution if focal changes in connectivity (e.g. due to segmental lesions) are to be studied, especially in a longitudinal manner.",False,0,,True,0

Here we show that dynamical constraints can similarly lead to slow thermalization and metastability in translationally invariant quantum many-body systems. We illustrate this general idea by considering two simple models: (i) a one-dimensional quantum analogue to classical constrained lattice gases where excitation hopping is constrained by the state of neighboring sites, mimicking excluded-volume interactions of dense fluids; and (ii) fully packed quantum dimers on the square lattice. Both models have a Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) point at which kinetic and potential energy constants are equal. To one side of the RK point, where kinetic energy dominates, thermalization is fast. To the other, where potential energy dominates, thermalization is slow, memory of initial conditions persists for long times, and separation of timescales leads to pronounced metastability before eventual thermalization. Furthermore, in analogy with what occurs in the relaxation of classical glasses, the slow-thermalization regime displays dynamical heterogeneity as manifested by spatially segregated growth of entanglement.",False,0,,True,0

Due to the poor scaling of the post Hartree-Fock wave function theory with system size/basis functions, the Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) is preferred for systems with a large number of molecules. However, traditional DFT cannot adequately account for medium to long range correlations which are necessary for modeling vdW interactions. Recent developments in DFT such as dispersion corrected models and nonlocal van der Waals functionals have attempted to address this weakness with a varying degree of success. In this work, we predict the VLE of argon and assess the performance of several density functionals and the second order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) by determining critical and structural properties via first principles Monte Carlo simulations. PBE-D3, BLYP-D3, and rVV10 functionals were used to compute vapor liquid coexistence curves, while PBE0-D3, M06-2X-D3, and MP2 were used for computing liquid density at a single state point. The performance of the PBE-D3 functional for VLE is superior to other functionals (BLYP-D3 and rVV10). At T = 85 K and P = 1 bar, MP2 performs well for the density and structural features of the first solvation shell in the liquid phase.",False,0,,True,0

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is used to measure the capacitance of the surface which is shown to be proportional to the solid/liquid interface area. To maintain a full gas coverage for prolonged periods the surface is held at an electrical potential which leads to hydrogen evolution. In the desired gas filled state the water does not touch the metallic area of the surface, however after gas has dissolved the water touches the metal which closes the electrochemical circuit causing hydrogen to be produced replenishing the gas in the surface and returning to the gas filled state; in this way the system is self-actuating.

The capacity to extract the color of objects is important in a variety of target identification and computer vision applications. Nonetheless, it remains challenging to achieve high-speed color imaging of moving objects in low-photon flux environments. The low-photon regime presents particular challenges for efficient spectral separation and identification, while unsupervised image reconstruction algorithms are often slow and computationally expensive. In this paper, we address both of these difficulties using a combination of hardware and computational solutions. We demonstrate color imaging using a Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) detector array for rapid, low-light-level data acquisition, with an integrated color filter array (CFA) for efficient spectral unmixing. High-speed image reconstruction is achieved using a bespoke Bayesian algorithm to produce high-fidelity color videos. The analysis is conducted first on simulated data allowing different pixel formats and photon flux scenarios to be investigated. Experiments are then performed using a plasmonic metasurface-based CFA, integrated with a 64 × 64 pixel format SPAD array. Passive imaging is conducted using white-light illumination of multi-colored, moving targets. Intensity information is recorded in a series of 2D photon-counting SPAD frames, from which accurate color information is extracted using the fast Bayesian method introduced herein. The per-frame reconstruction rate proves to be hundreds of times faster than the previous computational method. Furthermore, this approach yields additional information in the form of uncertainty measures, which can be used to assist with imaging system optimization and decision-making in real-world applications. The techniques demonstrated point the way towards rapid video-rate single-photon color imaging. The developed Bayesian algorithm, along with more advanced SPAD technology and utilization of time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) will permit live 3D, color videography in extremely low-photon flux environments.",False,0,,True,0

This paper introduces a unified formulation for sonar MIMO systems and focuses on the target detection and recognition capability of these systems. The multiplication of the number of transmitters and receivers not only provides a greater variety in terms of target view angles but also provides meaningful statistics on the target itself. Assuming that views are independent and the MIMO system is large enough, we demonstrate that target recognition is possible with only one MIMO snapshot. By studying the detection performance of MIMO sonars we also demonstrate that such systems solve the speckle noise and decorrelate individual scatterers inside one cell resolution, leading to super-resolution imaging. We also show that, if carefully designed, MIMO systems can surpass the resolution of a synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) system using the same bandwidth. All the discussed properties are derived from the independent view assumption. Fulfilling this assumption drives the design and efficiency of such systems.",False,0,,True,1

Transmission electron microscopy indicated the formation of high aspect-ratio segments of ITO NPs from the suspension through oriented attachment, that persisted in the deposited and sintered thin films to establish an efficient electrical percolating network within the less conductive GZO NP matrix.

These special case loading geometries are rather restrictive for those seeking insight into how microstructure evolves under the more general loading geometries that occur during natural deformation. Moreover, they are insufficient to establish how plastic flow properties might vary with the 3rd invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor (J3) which describes the stress configuration, and so applications that use those flow properties (e.g. glaciological and geodynamical modelling) may be correspondingly compromised. We describe an inexpensive and relatively straightforward modification to the widely used Paterson rock deformation apparatus that allows torsion experiments to be performed under simultaneously applied axial loads. We illustrate the performance of this modification with the results of combined stress experiments performed on Carrara marble and Solnhofen limestone at 500°–600 °C and confining pressures of 300 MPa. The flow stresses are best described by the Drucker yield function which includes J3-dependence. However, that J3-dependence is small. Hence for these initially approximately isotropic calcite rocks, flow stresses are adequately described by the J3-independent von Mises yield criterion that is widely used in deformation modelling. Loading geometry does, however, have a profound influence on the type and rate of development of crystallographic preferred orientation, and hence of mechanical anisotropy. The apparatus modification extends the range of loading geometries that can be used to investigate microstructural evolution, as well as providing greater scope for determining the shape of the yield surface in plastically anisotropic materials.",False,0,,True,0

In light of this, phosphorus acquisition efficiency is an important target trait for crop improvement, but it also provides an ecological adaptation for growth of plants in low nutrient environments. Increased root hair density has been shown to improve phosphorus uptake and plant health in a number of species. In several plant families, including Brassicaceae, root hair bearing cells are positioned on the epidermis according to their position in relation to cortex cells, with hair cells positioned in the cleft between two underlying cortex cells. Thus the number of cortex cells determines the number of epidermal cells in the root hair position. Previous research has associated phosphorus-limiting conditions with an increase in the number of cortex cell files in Arabidopsis thaliana roots, but they have not investigated the spatial or temporal domains in which these extra divisions occur or explored the consequences this has had on root hair formation. In this study, we use 3D reconstructions of root meristems to demonstrate that the anticlinal cell divisions seen under low phosphate are exclusive to the cortex. When grown on media containing replete levels of phosphorous, Arabidopsis thaliana plants almost invariably show 8 cortex cells; however when grown in phosphate limited conditions, seedlings typically develop 12-16 cortex cells, resulting in a significant increase in the number of epidermal cells at hair forming positions. These anticlinal divisions occur within the initial cells and can be seen within 24 hours of transfer of plants to low phosphorous conditions. We show that these changes in the underlying cortical cells feed into epidermal patterning by altering the regular spacing of root hairs.",False,0,,True,0

Recently, Middleton and Taylor linked the extraction of BPE into APE to the sign of the diapycnal component of the buoyancy flux, but their criterion can predict only diffusive convection instability, not salt finger instability. Here, we show that the problem can be corrected if the sign of the APE dissipation rate is used instead, making it emerge as the most fundamental criterion for double diffusive instabilities. A theory for the APE dissipation rate for a two-component fluid relative to its single-component counterpart is developed as a function of three parameters: the diffusivity ratio, the density ratio, and a spiciness parameter. The theory correctly predicts the occurrence of both salt finger and diffusive convection instabilities in the laminar unforced regime, while more generally predicting that the APE dissipation rate for a two-component fluid can be enhanced, suppressed, or even have the opposite sign compared to that for a single-component fluid, with important implications for the study of ocean mixing. Because negative APE dissipation can also occur in stably stratified single-component and doubly stable two-component stratified fluids, we speculate that only the thermodynamic theory of exergy can explain its physics; however, this necessitates accepting that APE dissipation is a conversion between APE and the internal energy component of BPE, in contrast to prevailing assumptions.",False,0,,True,0

Its performance is limited by a large lattice thermal conductivity, κL, and by intrinsically large p-type doping levels. In this paper, we address the thermal and electronic tunability of CaCuP. Isovalent alloying with As is possible over the full solid solution range in the CaCuP1-xAsx series. This leads to a reduction in κL due to mass fluctuations but also to a detrimental increase in p-type doping due to increasing Cu vacancies, which prevents zT improvement. Phase boundary mapping, exploiting small deviations from 1:1:1 stoichiometry, was used to explore doping tunability, finding increasing p-type doping to be much easier than decreasing the doping level. Calculation of the Lorenz number within the single parabolic band approximation leads to an unrealistic low κL for highly doped samples consistent with the multiband behavior in these materials. Overall, CaCuP and slightly Cu-enriched CaCu1.02P yield the best performance, with zT approaching 0.6 at 873 K.",False,0,,True,1

In this work, based on a hybrid beamforming antenna array structure, a physical layer security technique called directional modulation (DM) is studied for multi-beam multiplexing applications. The proposed design can form a more effective directional transmission through both beamforming and DM, while multiplexing multiple user beams through a common set of analog coefficients. In this hybrid beamforming structure, only one digital-to-analog converter (DAC) is connected to each subarray, and finite-precision phase shifters are further considered. Design examples for dual-beam multiplexing with an interleaved subarray structure and a localized subarray structure, respectively, are provided, which show that the interleaved subarray structure can form narrower mainlobe and a lower sidelobe level than the localized structure and has an overall better performance.",False,0,,True,0

Responses to date have been highly variable and it is not clear whether public health guidance has been informed by the best available evidence. We conducted a systematic review to synthesise the evidence on outbreaks of highly contagious diseases in prison. Methods We searched seven electronic databases for peer-reviewed articles and official reports published between 1 January 2000 and 28 July 2020. We included quantitative primary research that reported an outbreak of a given contagious disease in a correctional facility and examined the effects of interventions. We excluded studies that did not provide detail on interventions. We synthesised common themes using the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) guideline, identified gaps in the literature and critically appraised the effectiveness of various containment approaches. Results We identified 28 relevant studies. Investigations were all based in high-income countries and documented outbreaks of tuberculosis, influenza (types A and B), varicella, measles, mumps, adenovirus and COVID-19. Several themes were common to these reports, including the public health implications of infectious disease outbreaks in prison, and the role of interagency collaboration, health communication, screening for contagious diseases, restriction, isolation and quarantine, contact tracing, immunisation programmes, epidemiological surveillance and prison-specific guidelines in addressing any outbreaks. Discussion Prisons are high-risk settings for the transmission of contagious diseases and there are considerable challenges in managing outbreaks in them.

In pseudomonads, the two‐component system regulators CbrAB, NtrBC and PhoBR, are responsible for regulating cellular response to carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) respectively. Phosphonates are reduced organophosphorus compounds produced by a broad range of biota and typified by a direct C‐P bond. Numerous pseudomonads can use the environmentally abundant phosphonate species 2‐aminoethylphosphonate (2AEP) as a source of C, N, or P, but only PhoBR has been shown to play a role in 2AEP utilization. On the other hand, utilization of 2AEP as a C and N source is considered substrate inducible. Here, using the plant‐growth‐promoting rhizobacterium Pseudomonas putida BIRD‐1 we present evidence that 2AEP utilization is under dual regulation and only occurs upon depletion of C, N, or P, controlled by CbrAB, NtrBC, or PhoBR respectively. However, the presence of 2AEP was necessary for full gene expression, i.e. expression was substrate inducible. Mutation of a LysR‐type regulator, termed AepR, upstream of the 2AEP transaminase‐phosphonatase system (PhnWX), confirmed this dual regulatory mechanism. To our knowledge, this is the first study identifying coordination between global stress response and substrate‐specific regulators in phosphonate metabolism.",False,0,,True,0

Despite this, the standard approach to data acquisition, in such situations, is to specify the sequence of neuroimaging scans prior to data acquisition and to apply the same scans to all individuals. In this paper, we propose and illustrate an alternative approach, in which data would be analysed as it is acquired and used to choose the future scanning sequence: Active Acquisition. We propose three Active Acquisition scenarios based around multiple MRI modalities. In Scenario 1, we propose a simple use of near-real time analysis to decide whether to acquire more or higher resolution data, or acquire data with a different field<ns4:bold>-</ns4:bold>of<ns4:bold>-</ns4:bold>view. In Scenario 2, we simulate how multimodal MR data could be actively acquired and combined with a decision tree to classify a known outcome variable (in the simple example here, age). In Scenario 3, we simulate using Bayesian optimisation to actively search across multiple MRI modalities to find those which are most abnormal. These simulations suggest that by actively acquiring data, the scanning sequence can be adapted to each individual. We also consider the many outstanding practical and technical challenges involving normative data acquisition, MR physics, statistical modelling and clinical relevance. Despite these, we argue that Active Acquisition allows for potentially far more powerful, sensitive or rapid data acquisition, and may open up different perspectives on individual differences, clinical conditions, and biomarker discovery.</ns4:p>",False,0,,True,1

Mangroves have significantly reduced in global extent over the last 50 years, primarily as a result of deforestation caused by the expansion of agriculture and aquaculture in coastal environments. However, a limited number of studies have attempted to estimate changes in global mangrove extent, particularly into the 1990s, despite much of the loss in mangrove extent occurring pre-2000. This study has used L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) global mosaic datasets from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) for 11 epochs from 1996 to 2020 to develop a long-term time-series of global mangrove extent and change. The study used a map-to-image approach to change detection where the baseline map (GMW v2.5) was updated using thresholding and a contextual mangrove change mask. This approach was applied between all image-date pairs producing 10 maps for each epoch, which were summarised to produce the global mangrove time-series. The resulting mangrove extent maps had an estimated accuracy of 87.4% (95th conf. int.: 86.2–88.6%), although the accuracies of the individual gain and loss change classes were lower at 58.1% (52.4–63.9%) and 60.6% (56.1–64.8%), respectively. Sources of error included misregistration in the SAR mosaic datasets, which could only be partially corrected for, but also confusion in fragmented areas of mangroves, such as around aquaculture ponds. Overall, 152,604 km2 (133,996–176,910) of mangroves were identified for 1996, with this decreasing by −5245 km2 (−13,587–1444) resulting in a total extent of 147,359 km2 (127,925–168,895) in 2020, and representing an estimated loss of 3.4% over the 24-year time period. The Global Mangrove Watch Version 3.0 represents the most comprehensive record of global mangrove change achieved to date and is expected to support a wide range of activities, including the ongoing monitoring of the global coastal environment, defining and assessments of progress toward conservation targets, protected area planning and risk assessments of mangrove ecosystems worldwide.",False,0,,True,0

Research showed that changes in the pro and antisaccade latencies may be particularly sensitive to dementia and general executive functioning. These tasks show potential for diagnostic use, as they provide a rich set of potential eye tracking markers. One such marker, the coefficient of variation (CV), is so far overlooked. For biological markers to be reliable, they must be able to detect abnormalities in preclinical stages. MCI is often viewed as a predecessor to AD, with certain classifications of MCI more likely than others to progress to AD. The current study examined the potential of CV scores on pro and antisaccade tasks to distinguish participants with AD, amnestic MCI (aMCI), non-amnesiac MCI (naMCI), and older controls. The analyses revealed no significant differences in CV scores across the groups using the pro or antisaccade task. Antisaccade mean latencies were able to distinguish participants with AD and the MCI subgroups. Future research is needed on CV measures and attentional fluctuations in AD and MCI individuals to fully assess this measure's potential to robustly distinguish clinical groups with high sensitivity and specificity.",False,0,,True,0

Furthermore, the proposed platform enables the generation of an accurate μ$\mu$ -map for PET/MR systems with a robust alignment based on two-stage image registration using specifically designed PET templates. The proposed platform is based on the open-source NiftyPET software package used to generate multiple list-mode data bootstrap realizations and image reconstructions to determine the precision of the two-stage registration and any image-derived statistics. For all the analyses, iterative image reconstruction was employed with and without modeled shift-invariant point spread function and with varying iterations of the ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm. The impact of the activity outside the field of view (FOV) was assessed using two acquisitions of 30 min each, with and without the activity outside the FOV.The utility of the platform has been demonstrated by providing a standard and an advanced phantom analysis including the estimation of spatial resolution using all cylindrical inserts. In the imaging planes close to the edge of the axial FOV, we observed deterioration in the quantitative accuracy, reduced resolution (FWHM increased by 1-2 mm), reduced contrast, and background uniformity due to the activity outside the FOV. Although it slows convergence, the PSF reconstruction had a positive impact on resolution and contrast recovery, but the degree of improvement depended on the regions. The uncertainty analysis based on bootstrap resampling of raw PET data indicated high precision of the two-stage registration.We demonstrated that phantom imaging using the proposed methodology with the metric of spatial resolution and multiple bootstrap realizations may be helpful in more accurate evaluation of PET systems as well as in facilitating fine tuning for optimal imaging parameters in PET/MR and PET/CT clinical research studies.",False,0,,True,0

We discuss how these solutions are motivated by the analytic structure of spatially compact finite energy pulse solutions of the source-free Maxwell equations generated from complex chiral eigen-modes of a chirality operator. Complex gravitational pulse solutions to the linearized source-free Einstein equations are classified in terms of their chirality and generate a family of non-stationary real spacetime metrics. Particular members of these families are used as backgrounds in analyzing time-like solutions to the geodesic equation for test particles. They are found numerically to exhibit both single and double jet-like features with dimensionless aspect ratios suggesting that it may be profitable to include such backgrounds in simulations of astrophysical jet dynamics from rotating accretion discs involving electromagnetic fields.",False,0,,True,0

We treat the scaling dimension of this operator, related to the mass of the one scalar field in the gravity theory, as a free parameter. One dimension in the regular geometry is compactified on a shrinking circle, hence mimicking confinement in the resulting dual four-dimensional theories. We study the mass spectrum of bosonic states. The lightest state in this spectrum is a scalar particle. Along the regular (confining) branch of solutions, we find the presence of a tachyonic instability in part of the parameter space, reached by a smooth deformation of the mass spectrum, as a function of the boundary value of the background scalar field in the gravity theory. In a region of parameter space nearby the tachyonic one, the lightest scalar particle can be interpreted as an approximate dilaton, sourced by the trace of the stress-energy tensor, and its mass is parametrically suppressed. We also compute the free energy, along several branches of gravity solutions. We find that both the dilatonic and tachyonic regions of parameter space, identified along the branch of confining solutions, are hidden behind a first-order phase transition, so that they are not realized as stable solutions, irrespectively of the scaling dimension of the deforming field-theory operator. The (approximate) dilaton, in particular, appears in metastable solutions. Yet, the mass of the lightest state, computed close to the phase transition, is (mildly) suppressed. This feature is amplified when the (free) parameter controlling the scaling dimension of the deformation is $5/2$, half the dimension of space-time in the field theory.",False,0,,True,0

Here, we have developed an analytic framework, named PRADA, that identifies oncogenic RNA-binding proteins through the systematic detection of coordinated changes in their target regulons. Application of this approach to data collected from clinical samples, patient-derived xenografts, and cell line models of colon cancer metastasis revealed the RNA-binding protein RBMS1 as a suppressor of colon cancer progression. We observed that silencing RBMS1 results in increased metastatic capacity in xenograft mouse models, and that restoring its expression blunts metastatic liver colonization. We have found that RBMS1 functions as a posttranscriptional regulator of RNA stability by directly binding its target mRNAs. Together, our findings establish a role for RBMS1 as a previously unknown regulator of RNA stability and as a suppressor of colon cancer metastasis with clinical utility for risk stratification of patients. SIGNIFICANCE: By applying a new analytic approach to transcriptomic data from clinical samples and models of colon cancer progression, we have identified RBMS1 as a suppressor of metastasis and as a post-transcriptional regulator of RNA stability. Notably, RBMS1 silencing and downregulation of its targets are negatively associated with patient survival.See related commentary by Carter, p. 1261.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1241.",False,0,,True,0

Studies identifying this risk have used electronic health record (EHR) platforms in which clinical conditions must be properly identified. We set out to define and evaluate various methods of deriving BMI measurements in OpenSAFELY-TPP, an EHR platform that has been used in many studies relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods With the approval of NHS England, we use routine clinical data from &gt;22 million patients in England to define four derivations of BMI. We compare the number of patients with each type of BMI measurement and the number of measurements themselves. We also examine the plausibility of each derivation by looking at the distribution of measurements and counting values out of the expected range. To evaluate how frequently the BMI derivations are recorded, we track the number of new measurements recorded over time and the average time between updates in patients with multiple measurements. Results Primary constraints in creating the optimal BMI derivation is coverage, accuracy, and computational complexity. BMI derivations calculated from height and weight contain a few extreme outliers that affect aggregated statistics. SNOMED-recorded BMI records are more accurate on average and offer better coverage across the population. The canonical OpenSAFELY definition – which uses calculated BMI as a first instance and SNOMED-recorded BMI if missing – offers the best coverage, but contains the same extreme outliers found in calculated BMI and is the most computationally expensive of all methods. Conclusions Across all derivations, some cleaning should be performed to drop implausible outliers. Using calculated BMI on its own does not offer the best coverage or accuracy. In choosing between SNOMED-recorded BMI and the current OpenSAFELY implementation, users should decide whether they would like to maximise computational efficiency or coverage.</ns3:p>",False,0,,True,0

In this study, these key concepts are defined and quantified for a number of gray, green and hybrid strategies, aimed at improving the capacity issues of an existing integrated urban wastewater system. These interventions are investigated by means of a regret-based approach, which evaluates the robustness (that is the ability to perform well under deep uncertainty conditions) of each strategy in terms of the three qualities through integration of multiple objectives (i.e., sewer flooding, river water quality, combined sewer overflows, river flooding, greenhouse gas emissions, cost and acceptability) across four different future scenarios. The results indicate that strategies found to be robust in terms of sustainability were typically also robust for resilience and reliability across future scenarios. However, strategies found to be robust in terms of their resilience and, in particular, for reliability did not guarantee robustness for sustainability. Conventional gray infrastructure strategies were found to lack robustness in terms of sustainability due to their unbalanced economic, environmental and social performance. Such limitations were overcome, however, by implementing hybrid solutions that combine green retrofits and gray rehabilitation solutions.",False,0,,True,0

A widely used strategy is to introduce chlorine into the drinking water distribution system (DWDS). A subtle potential risk is that non-lethal chlorine residuals may select for chlorine resistant species in the biofilms that reside in DWDS. Here, we quantify the thickness, density, and coverage of naturally occurring multi-species biofilms grown on slides in tap water with and without chlorine, using fluorescence microscopy. We then place the slides in an annular rotating reactor and expose them to fluid-wall shears, which are redolent of those on pipe walls in DWDS. We found that biofilms in chlorine experiment were thicker, denser and with higher coverage than in non-chlorine conditions under all flow regimes and during incubation. This suggests that the formation and development of biofilms was promoted by chlorine. Surprisingly, for both chlorinated and non-chlorinated conditions, biofilm thickness, density and coverage were all positively correlated with shear stress. More differences were detected in biofilms under the different flow regimes in non-chlorine than in chlorine experiments. This suggests a more robust biofilm under chlorine conditions. While this might imply less mobilization of biofilms in high shear events in pipe networks, it might also provide refuge from chlorine residuals for pathogens.",False,0,,True,0

The novelty of this framework is its ability to learn and perform bagging without relying on simulations. The learning process is accomplished through a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm introduced and designed to find the best grasping points of the bag based on a set of compact state representations. The framework utilises a set of primitive actions and represents the task in five states. In our experiments, the framework reached 60% and 80% success rates after around 3 h of training in the real world when starting the bagging task from folded and unfolded states, respectively.

So far, all room temperature polariton condensate lattices have been achieved by nanoimprinting microcavities, which by nature lacks the crucial tunability required for realistic reconfigurable simulators. Here, we report the observation of a quantised oscillating nonlinear quantum fluid in 1D and 2D potentials in an organic microcavity at room temperature, achieved by an on-the-fly fully tuneable optical approach. Remarkably, the condensate is delocalised from the excitation region by macroscopic distances, leading both to longer coherence and a threshold one order of magnitude lower than that with a conventional Gaussian excitation profile. We observe different mode selection behaviour compared to inorganic materials, which highlights the anomalous scaling of blueshift with pump intensity and the presence of sizeable energy-relaxation mechanisms. Our work is a major step towards a fully tuneable polariton simulator at room temperature.",False,0,,True,0

Radio data gathered through the minimization of drive test (MDT), a 3GPP standard technique, is commonly used for radio network analysis. Collecting MDT data in different geographical areas is inefficient and constrained by the terrain conditions and user presence, hence is not an adequate technique for dynamic radio environments. In this paper, we study a generative model for RSRP prediction, exploiting MDT data and a digital twin (DT), and propose a data-driven, two-tier neural network (NN) model. In the first tier, environmental information related to user equipment (UE), base stations (BS) and network key performance indicators (KPI) are extracted through a variational autoencoder (VAE). The second tier is designed as a likelihood model. Here, the environmental features and real MDT data features are adopted, formulating an integrated training process.

To address the relation between the cerebellum and internal models, we adopt the chip metaphor that has been used to represent the combination of a homogeneous cerebellar cortical microcircuit with individual microzones having unique external connections. This metaphor indicates that identifying the function of a particular cerebellar chip requires knowledge of both the general microcircuit algorithm and the chip's individual connections. Here we use a popular candidate algorithm as embodied in the adaptive filter, which learns to decorrelate its inputs from a reference ('teaching', 'error') signal. This algorithm is computationally powerful enough to be used in a very wide variety of engineering applications. However, the crucial issue is whether the external connectivity required by such applications can be implemented biologically. We argue that some applications appear to be in principle biologically implausible: these include the Smith predictor and Kalman filter (for state estimation), and the feedback-error-learning scheme for adaptive inverse control. However, even for plausible schemes, such as forward models for noise cancellation and novelty-detection, and the recurrent architecture for adaptive inverse control, there is unlikely to be a simple mapping between microzone function and internal model structure. This initial analysis suggests that cerebellar involvement in particular behaviours is therefore unlikely to have a neat classification into categories such as 'forward model'. It is more likely that cerebellar microzones learn a task-specific adaptive-filter operation which combines a number of signal-processing roles.",False,0,,True,1

We show how gauge-invariant Langevin source terms can be obtained for the complete set of Einstein equations in their Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formulation by providing a recipe for coarse-graining the spacetime in any small gauge. These stochastic source terms are defined in terms of the only dynamical scalar degree of freedom in single-field inflation and all depend simply on the first two time derivatives of the coarse-graining window function, on the gauge-invariant mode functions that satisfy the Mukhanov-Sasaki evolution equation, and on the slow-roll parameters. It is shown that this reasoning can also be applied to include gravitons as stochastic sources, thus enabling the study of all relevant degrees of freedom of general relativity for inflation. We validate the efficacy of these Langevin dynamics directly using an example in uniform field gauge, obtaining the stochastic <a:math xmlns:a=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline""><a:mi>e</a:mi></a:math>-fold number in the long wavelength limit without the need for a first-passage-time analysis.

Gamete (sperm and oocyte) genomes are transcriptionally silent until embryonic genome activation (EGA) following fertilization. EGA in humans had been thought to occur around the eight-cell stage, but recent findings suggest that it is triggered in one-cell embryos, by fertilization. Phosphorylation and other post-translational modifications during fertilization may instate transcriptionally favorable chromatin and activate oocyte-derived transcription factors (TFs) to initiate EGA. Expressed genes lay on cancer-associated pathways and their identities predict upregulation by MYC and other cancer-associated TFs. One interpretation of this is that the onset of EGA, and the somatic cell trajectory to cancer, are mechanistically related: cancer initiates epigenetically. We describe how fertilization might be linked to the initiation of EGA and involve distinctive processes recapitulated in cancer.

We describe how fertilization might be linked to the initiation of EGA and involve distinctive processes recapitulated in cancer. Measuring mammalian embryonic transcriptional initiationThe first embryonic transcription, EGA (see Glossary), is a critical aspect of the establishment of totipotency [1.Condic M.L. Totipotency: what it is and what it is not.Stem Cells Dev. 2014; 23: 796-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar], yet the initiation and early profile of EGA are poorly understood in any vertebrate species [2.Jukam D. et al.Zygotic genome activation in vertebrates.Dev. Cell. 2017; 42: 316-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar]. In fish and amphibian models, the kinetics of EGA are elusively rapid and in mammals, the focus here, embryos have been of indeterminate age, asynchronous, pooled (smoothing expression), or transcript levels obscured by changes in poly(A) tail length [2.Jukam D. et al.Zygotic genome activation in vertebrates.Dev.

Transient polyadenylation of a maternal mRNA following fertilization of mouse eggs.J. Reprod. Fertil. 1997; 109: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar]. Mouse embryonic transcription is thought to initiate by the late one-cell stage ('minor' EGA), followed by 'major' EGA in two-cell embryos [6.Xue Z. et al.Genetic programs in human and mouse early embryos revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing.Nature. 2013; 500: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar]; EGA in humans has been held to begin at the four-to-eight cell stage [7.Braude P. et al.Human gene expression first occurs between the four- and eight-cell stages of preimplantation development.Nature. 1988; 332: 459-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar], even though the latency period between fertilization and EGA would have to last at least 2 days. Notwithstanding hints that human EGA initiates earlier than the four-to-eight cell stage [6.Xue Z. et al.Genetic programs in human and mouse early embryos revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing.Nature. 2013; 500: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar,8.Leng L. et al.Single-cell transcriptome analysis of uniparental embryos reveals parent-of-origin effects on human preimplantation development.Cell Stem Cell. 2019; 25: 697-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,9.Vassena R. et al.Waves of early transcriptional activation and pluripotency program initiation during human preimplantation development.Development. 2011; 138: 3699-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar], no model accounts for how the embryo genome would be sustained in a transcriptionally silent state, embryonic processes regulated, or the nature of the autonomous cue that triggered transcription.Resolving these issues would benefit from a detailed profile of transcriptional initiation to enable a model of the underlying mechanism. Accurate determination of transcription immediately after fertilization is confounded by modulation of transcript polyadenylation in early embryos to control translation, which may distort estimates of relative levels [3.Blower M.D. et al.Combining different mRNA capture methods to analyze the transcriptome: analysis of the Xenopus laevis transcriptome.PLoS One. 2013; 8e77700Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar,5.Temeles G.L. Schultz R.M. Transient polyadenylation of a maternal mRNA following fertilization of mouse eggs.J. Reprod. Fertil. 1997; 109: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar]. This was recently addressed by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) in human embryos [10.Asami M. et al.Human embryonic genome activation initiates at the one-cell stage.Cell Stem Cell. 2022; 29: 209-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar]. The method employed a subtractive approach that was independent of transcript polyadenylation status and accommodated the potential for further profile distortion due to maternal RNA inheritance and degradation, in which RNA from the mature, metaphase II (mII) oocyte is transmitted to the embryo during fertilization and subsequently degraded [8.Leng L. et al.Single-cell transcriptome analysis of uniparental embryos reveals parent-of-origin effects on human preimplantation development.Cell Stem Cell. 2019; 25: 697-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,11.Sha Q.Q. et al.Dynamics and clinical relevance of maternal mRNA clearance during the oocyte-to-embryo transition in humans.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar]. Because scRNA-seq read counts for mII oocytes and embryos required negligible normalization, they were readily comparable, facilitating the detection of EGA [10.Asami M. et al.Human embryonic genome activation initiates at the one-cell stage.Cell Stem Cell. 2022; 29: 209-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar]. Upregulation was corroborated orthogonally and by conservation with the onset of EGA in mouse one-cell embryos [12.Asami M. et al.Mouse fertilization triggers a transcription program conserved in human one-cell embryos.bioRxiv. 2020; (Published online September 15, 2020)https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.15.298018Google Scholar]. Moreover, maternal transcript degradation in human embryos is a gradual process occurring over several days following fertilization [8.Leng L. et al.Single-cell transcriptome analysis of uniparental embryos reveals parent-of-origin effects on human preimplantation development.Cell Stem Cell. 2019; 25: 697-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,11.Sha Q.Q. et al.Dynamics and clinical relevance of maternal mRNA clearance during the oocyte-to-embryo transition in humans.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar], so its contribution at the one-cell stage is small. Addressing these challenges by scRNA-seq has shown that EGA initiates at the one-cell stage in humans [9.Vassena R. et al.Waves of early transcriptional activation and pluripotency program initiation during human preimplantation development.Development. 2011; 138: 3699-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar]. A discrete set of genes is expressed, suggesting that EGA is programmed, rather than stochastic. We now speculate on the implications of this finding.EGA onset predicts the involvement of cancer-associated TFsGenes upregulated in EGA [10.Asami M. et al.Human embryonic genome activation initiates at the one-cell stage.Cell Stem Cell. 2022; 29: 209-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar] can be used bioinformatically to infer the TFs mediating expression. These include the pleiotropic TF, MYC, which binds to many genes, often in cells with regenerative and proliferative potential and affecting metabolic pathways and differentiation [13.Das S.K. et al.MYC: a complex problem.Trends Cell Biol. 2022; (Published online August 10, 2022. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcb.2022.07.006)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 14.Eilers M.

MYC often induces small changes in target gene expression, as observed at the onset of EGA [10.Asami M. et al.Human embryonic genome activation initiates at the one-cell stage.Cell Stem Cell. 2022; 29: 209-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar,12.Asami M. et al.Mouse fertilization triggers a transcription program conserved in human one-cell embryos.bioRxiv. 2020; (Published online September 15, 2020)https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.15.298018Google Scholar,18.Baluapuri A. et al.Target gene-independent functions of MYC oncoproteins.Nat.

We speculate that together with chromatin remodeling, these modulate TF activity in response to fertilization-induced signaling or chromatin (epigenetic) remodeling, or less directly, as can occur in response to cytoskeletal remodeling or reconfigured phase compartmentalization [38.Li J. et al.Control of chromatin organization and chromosome behavior during the cell cycle through phase separation.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021; 22: 12271Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar]. In an extension of this model, the onset of embryogenesis is ectopically recapitulated in events that lead to carcinogenesis (Figure 1).How are genes marked for the first embryonic transcription?At least four mutually inclusive possibilities account for how one-cell embryos designate genes for expression.First, by association with transcription-activating chromatin. Topologically associating domains (TADs) occur in mouse early embryos and could coordinate genome activation by spatial proximation of EGA genes [39.Flyamer I.M. et al.Single-nucleus Hi-C reveals unique chromatin reorganization at oocyte-to-zygote transition.Nature. 2017; 544: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar,40.Ke Y. et al.3D chromatin structures of mature gametes and structural reprogramming during mammalian embryogenesis.Cell. 2017; 170: 367-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar]. It is unclear if TADs are preformed in gametes [39.Flyamer I.M. et al.Single-nucleus Hi-C reveals unique chromatin reorganization at oocyte-to-zygote transition.Nature. 2017; 544: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar] or assemble after fertilization [40.Ke Y. et al.3D chromatin structures of mature gametes and structural reprogramming during mammalian embryogenesis.Cell. 2017; 170: 367-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar], whether the onset of EGA initiates within such domains or, indeed, if early activated genes are clustered and chromatin remodeling seeds expression of nearby genes. Alternatively, activation may occur independently at dispersed loci.Secondly, via TF cognate DNA sequences. For example, MYC preferentially recognizes the E-box, CACGTG, in a DNA-methylation-sensitive manner [41.Prendergast G.C. Ziff E.B. Methylation-sensitive sequence-specific DNA binding by the c-Myc basic region.Science. 1991; 251: 186-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar], whilst E2F4 has the consensus binding site, TTTCGCGC [42.Kovesdi I. et al.Identification of a cellular transcription factor involved in E1A trans-activation.Cell. 1986; 45: 219-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar]. The default in this second scenario is transcriptional quiescence (the initial state of most genes), with binding of activating TFs to motifs within targeted promoters causing expression of associated genes at the onset of EGA.Thirdly, meiotic exit triggered by fertilization may result in an epigenetic configuration that is more favorable for transcription at genes upregulated in EGA, likely involving the appearance of histone modifications associated with transcriptional activation [12.Asami M. et al.Mouse fertilization triggers a transcription program conserved in human one-cell embryos.bioRxiv. 2020; (Published online September 15, 2020)https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.15.298018Google Scholar].Fourthly, parentally inherited, gamete-borne epigenetic marks might instate transcription. Inherited marks characterize parentally biased, imprinted gene expression in mouse blastocysts and most correspond to trimethylated histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and some to DNA methylation [43.Santini L. et al.Genomic imprinting in mouse blastocysts is predominantly associated with H3K27me3.Nat. Comm. 2021; 12: 3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar]. Parentally inherited marks pass through the one-cell stage, so could influence EGA. Other marks affecting transcription (e.g., H3K4me3) may not correspond to canonical imprints [43.Santini L. et al.Genomic imprinting in mouse blastocysts is predominantly associated with H3K27me3.Nat. Comm. 2021; 12: 3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar,44.Samata M. et al.Intergenerationally maintained histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation is instructive for future gene activation.Cell. 2020; 182: 127-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar]. It is also possible that parentally acquired (i.e., nonprogrammed) traits are epigenetically transmitted to offspring to promote gene expression at the one-cell stage. This would exemplify epigenetic inheritance [45.Skvortsova K. et al.Functions and mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance in animals.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19: 774-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar] that may not become apparent until adulthood, as can occur in nuclear transfer cloning [46.Perry A.C.F. Wakayama T. Untimely ends and new beginnings in mouse cloning.Nature Genet. 2002; 30: 243-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar].Maternal chromatin transitions from a condensed metaphase configuration during meiotic progression, whereas protamines, which comprise 85% of human sperm nucleoprotein, are exhaustively removed and replaced with histones [47.Zhou L. Dean J. Reprogramming the genome to totipotency in mouse embryos.Trends Cell Biol. 2015; 25: 82-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar]. Differences in parental chromatin thus likely produce distinctive parental gene expression profiles at the onset of EGA.Totipotency and the expression trajectory of upregulated transcriptsA complete model of totipotency will accommodate transcription in one-cell embryos: in humans, transcript levels for most of this set of EGA genes decline with the onset of 'major' EGA at the four-to-eight-cell stage [1.Condic M.L. Totipotency: what it is and what it is not.Stem Cells Dev. 2014; 23: 796-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,7.Braude P. et al.Human gene expression first occurs between the four- and eight-cell stages of preimplantation development.Nature. 1988; 332: 459-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar,10.Asami M. et al.Human embryonic genome activation initiates at the one-cell stage.Cell Stem Cell. 2022; 29: 209-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar].

In addition, TFs upregulated from around the eight-cell stage, including OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG, are not predicted to regulate genes expressed at the one-cell stage [10.Asami M. et al.Human embryonic genome activation initiates at the one-cell stage.Cell Stem Cell. 2022; 29: 209-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar,50.Niakan K.K.

After optimising its performance for the usage in likelihood expressions, the shrinkage estimator yields subdominant bias and variance comparable to that of the standard estimator with a factor $\sim 50$ less realisations.

This method is based on measuring the length of a material line in the flow. Depending on the nature of the flow, the fluid can be mixed very efficiently which causes the line to stretch. Here, we study a method that adaptively increases the resolution at locations along the line where folds lead to a high curvature. This reduces the computational cost greatly which allows us to study unprecedented parameter regimes.

To meet the necessary safety standards, effective collision avoidance technologies are required to ensure that the number of accidents are kept to a minimum. As large numbers of autonomous vehicles, operating together on roads, can be regarded as a swarm system, we propose a bio-inspired collision avoidance strategy using virtual pheromones; an approach that has evolved effectively in nature over many millions of years. Previous research using virtual pheromones showed the potential of pheromone-based systems to maneuver a swarm of robots. However, designing an individual controller to maximise the performance of the entire swarm is a major challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based approach that is able to train a controller that introduces collision avoidance behaviour. To accelerate training, we propose a novel sampling strategy called <italic xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">Highlight Experience Replay</i> and integrate it with a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm with noise added to the weights and biases of the artificial neural network to improve exploration.

The experimental results showed that the proposed DRL-based controller outperformed the manually-tuned controller in terms of stability, effectiveness, robustness and ease of tuning process.

Recently, the MaNGA survey identified six dwarf galaxies that appear to have an AGN that is preventing on-going star formation. It is therefore timely to study the physical properties of dwarf galaxies, in particular whether the presence of an AGN can affect their evolution. Using the moving mesh code arepo, we have investigated different models of AGN activity, ranging from simple energy-driven spherical winds to collimated, mass-loaded, bipolar outflows in high-resolution simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies hosting an active black hole. Our simulations also include a novel implementation of star formation and mechanical supernova (SN) feedback. We find that AGN outflows have a small but systematic effect on the central star formation rates (SFRs) for all set-ups explored, while substantial effects on the global SFR are only obtained with strong SNe and a sustained high-luminosity AGN with an isotropic wind. This suggests that AGN feedback in dwarf galaxies is unlikely to directly regulate their global SFRs. There is, however, a significant effect on outflow properties, which are notably enhanced by the AGN to much higher outflow temperatures and velocities, in agreement with kinematic signatures from the MaNGA survey. This indicates that AGN may play an indirect role in regulating the baryon cycle in dwarf galaxies by hindering cosmic gas inflows.",False,0,,True,0

While overall improvements towards reducing health effects from ambient air pollution are recorded, comprehensive and consistent assessments of the long-term impact of policy interventions are still scarce. In this paper, we conduct a model assessment over a 40 year period of air pollution in the UK. In order to correct for the short and longer term variability of meteorological factors contributing to trends in ambient concentrations of priority air pollutants (nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, fine particulate matter and ozone), we use a fixed meteorological year for all model simulations. Hence, the modelled changes in air pollutant concentrations and related health effects are solely a function of the changes in emissions since 1970. These changes in emissions are primarily driven by policy interventions, ranging from phasing out of specific fuels or substances, to regulating the use of chemicals and driving the development of cleaner, more efficient technologies. Over the 40 year period, UK attributable mortality due to exposure to PM 2.5 and NO 2 have declined by 56% and 44% respectively, while ozone attributable respiratory mortality increased by 17% over the same period (however, with a slight decrease by 14% between 2000 and 2010).",False,0,,True,0

Here, we report estimates of local and global contributions to trace-level plutonium in soil from a former, fast-breeder reactor site. The measured 240 Pu/ 239 Pu ratio is anomalously low, as per the reduced 240 Pu yield expected in plutonium bred with fast neutrons. Anomalies in plutonium concentration and isotopic ratio suggest forensic insight into specific activities on site, such as clean-up or structural change. Local and global 239 Pu contributions on-site are estimated at (34 ± 1)% and (66 ± 3)%, respectively, with mass concentrations of (183 ± 6) fg g −1 and (362 ± 13) fg g −1 . The latter is consistent with levels at undisturbed and distant sites, (384 ± 44) fg g −1 , where no local contribution is expected. The 240 Pu/ 239 Pu ratio for site-derived material is estimated at 0.05 ± 0.04.

This study quantifies the liquid surface motion of LJIC during the primary breakup process, which has not been quantified due to the optical limitation close to the nozzle exit. The interfacial velocity of a breaking liquid jet indicates the local interaction of the gas and liquid flows and determines the initial velocity of the stripped droplets. The local interfacial liquid velocities of LJIC have only been estimated from theoretical and computational studies, which have not been evaluated from measurements. Optical Connectivity (OC) introduces a laser beam through an atomiser nozzle and relies on total internal reflection at the liquid interface to propagate the laser light inside the continuous liquid to record the instantaneous features of the interface of the continuous liquid during the primary atomisation at the near nozzle region through imaging of the emitted fluorescent intensity from the liquid flow. The current study combines Optical Connectivity with Optical Flow Velocimetry (OFV) to quantify the time-dependent, local interfacial velocity of the liquid interface structures of the LJIC for gas Weber numbers between 14.9 - 112.6 and liquid-to-gas momentum ratios between 2.1 - 36.4.

The samples were characterized by x-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The results show that stress is present in the as-deposited bilayers and that negligible interdiffusion occurs in the absence of Cu. The presence of Cu facilitates rapid interdiffusion, predominantly via Cd migration into the ZnTe phase. Zn migration into CdTe is limited to areas around defects and grain boundaries. Ternary CdxZn1-xTe interlayers are formed, and the extent of alloy formation ranges from 0.08 &amp;lt; x &amp;lt; 0.5 throughout the whole ZnTe layer.

Interactions between organic compounds and clay minerals play an important role in processes such as drinking water treatment, remediation of contaminated soil, oil recovery, and fabricating complicated nanomaterials, and there have been claims that organic compound-clay mineral interaction created the ordering that is necessary for the genesis of life. In many organisms, interaction between organic molecules and biominerals makes it possible to control the growth of bones, teeth, and shells. Adhesion of carboxylic acid, -COO(H), and pyridine, -C5H5N(H+), on the {0001} plane of α-alumina wafers has been investigated with atomic force microscopy (AFM) in chemical force mapping (CFM) mode. Both functional groups adhered to α-alumina in deionized water at pH < 5, and adhesion decreased as NaCl or CaCl2 concentration increased. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed that Na+ and Ca2+ adsorbed to the α-alumina surface at pH < 5, decreasing surface interaction with the carboxylic acid and pyridine groups. We interpret the results as evidence that the tips adhere to alumina through hydrogen bonding when only water is present. In solutions containing NaCl and CaCl2, cations are adsorbed but Cl- is not. When NaCl solutions are replaced by CaCl2, Ca2+ replaces Na+, but rinsing with ultrapure deionized water (pH 5.6) could not restore the original protonated surface. The results demonstrate that the alumina surface at pH 3 has a higher affinity for inorganic cations than for -COO(H) or -C5H5N(H+), in spite of the known positive surface charge of α-alumina {0001} wafers. These results demonstrate that solution salinity plays an important role in surface properties, controlling surface tension (i.e., contact angle) and adsorption affinity on α-alumina and, by analogy, on clay minerals.",False,0,,True,0

A preferable method to create precise structured surfaces is using single point diamond turning with on-machine surface measurement (OMSM). However, fabricating these surfaces often pose challenges due to steep gradients and discontinuous slopes, leading to significant form errors in machining. We propose an innovative solution by employing partial differential equation (PDE) filtration in a closed loop compensation process to enhance form accuracy and surface roughness compared to traditional methods. We tackle the problem of over-smoothing induced profile error encountered with traditional Gaussian filters. The proposed compensation strategy adapts to surface curvature and reduces instrument noise during on-machine measurements. Experimental of fabricating a segment spherical artefact, demonstrate improved precision. After adopting the proposed method, the form error is reduced from 1.2 µm to 0.5 µm and vibration ripples are mitigated, and a better surface finish is achieved.",False,0,,True,0

Here we present the implementation of machine learning algorithms to model the RBS sequence–phenotype relationship from representative subsets of large combinatorial RBS libraries allowing the accurate prediction of optimal high-producers. Applied to a recombinant monoterpenoid production pathway in Escherichia coli, our approach was able to boost production titers by over 60% when screening under 3% of a library. To facilitate library screening, a multiwell plate fermentation procedure was developed, allowing increased screening throughput with sufficient resolution to discriminate between high and low producers. High producers from one library did not translate during scale-up, but the reduced screening requirements allowed rapid rescreening at the larger scale. This methodology is potentially compatible with any biochemical pathway and provides a powerful tool toward predictive design of bacterial production chassis.",False,0,,True,1

Young white-coloured and older pigmented roots of Cistus monspeliensis were excised (to simulate death by mechanical severance) or frozen (to simulate death by cell rupture) and immediately buried in soil. CO2 loss from soil was then measured over time. In a parallel experiment, the rate of CO2 loss from severed or ruptured roots in the absence of soil was determined. Our results revealed large differences in root chemistry related to age, with young roots having a lower C:N ratio and a greater nutrient content (soluble C, N, P and K). Both root age and mode of death resulted in very different temporal patterns of C release from soil. The amount of C lost from soil followed the series: severed white roots (42.6 ± 3.3 mg C) > ruptured pigmented roots (27.7 ± 0.4 mg C) = ruptured white roots (27.1 ± 0.5 mg C) > severed pigmented roots (10.1 ± 1.0 mg C) > soil only (3.0 ± 0.2 mg C). Therefore, depending on the treatment, 7 to 41% of the total root-derived C was lost as CO2 over the duration of the experiment. Comparison with soil-free treatments revealed that the CO2 release from the severed roots buried in soil was not associated with microbial breakdown but caused by root-induced autophagy in an attempt to keep themselves metabolically active. Ruptured roots also induced a rapid loss of CO2 which we ascribe to the diffusive loss of root solutes into the soil and subsequent microbial mineralization. Surprisingly, the rate of C loss from soil was greater from the severed root tips than those that were ruptured. Our results imply two distinct routes of C loss dependent on how roots die, one which bypasses the microbial community and one which flows through it.",False,0,,True,0

Building on the CQC report, our article addresses a cluster of legal uncertainties surrounding DNACPR decisions, in particular about the grounds for such decisions and the correct procedures for the legally required consultation, including with whom to consult. This article will also analyse commonly used DNACPR forms, as well as the Recommended Summary Plan for Emergency Care and Treatment (ReSPECT) form, which aims to incorporate DNACPR decisions as part of more holistic end-of-life care planning. The analysis shows that all forms exhibit shortcomings in reflecting the legal requirements for DNACPR decisions.

This contributes to the One Health Approach, which investigates health issues at the intersection of people, wild and domestic animals, together with their changing environments. Nonetheless, the emerging field of wildlife cancer is currently constrained by methodological limitations in detecting cancer using non-invasive sampling. In addition, the suspected differential susceptibility and resistance of species to cancer often make the choice of a unique model species difficult for field biologists. Here, we provide an overview of the importance of pursuing the study of cancer in non-model organisms and we review the currently available methods to detect, measure and quantify cancer in the wild, as well as the methodological limitations to be overcome to develop novel approaches inspired by diagnostic techniques used in human medicine. The methodology we propose here will help understand and hopefully fight this major disease by generating general knowledge about cancer, variation in its rates, tumour-suppressor mechanisms across species as well as its link to life history and physiological characters. Moreover, this is expected to provide key information about cancer in wildlife, which is a top priority due to the accelerated anthropogenic change in the past decades that might favour cancer progression in wild populations.",False,0,,True,0

The past decade has seen staggering progress in strigolactone biology, permitting highly detailed understanding of their signalling, synthesis and biological roles – or so it seems. However, phylogenetic analyses show that strigolactone signalling mediated by the D14‐ SCF MAX 2 ‐ SMXL 7 complex is only one of a number of closely related signalling pathways, and is much less ubiquitous in land plants than might be expected. The existence of closely related pathways, such as the KAI 2‐ SMAX 1 module, challenges many of our assumptions about strigolactones, and in particular emphasises how little we understand about the specificity of strigolactone signalling with respect to related signalling pathways. In this review, we examine recent advances in strigolactone signalling, taking a holistic evolutionary view to identify the ambiguities and uncertainties in our understanding. We highlight that while we now have highly detailed molecular models for the core mechanism of D14‐ SMXL 7 signalling, we still do not understand the ligand specificity of D14, the specificity of its interaction with SMXL 7, nor the specificity of SMXL 7 function. Our analysis therefore identifies key areas requiring further study.",False,0,,True,1

However, limited understanding of the biomineralization capacity of environmental bacteria impedes application. We therefore surveyed the environment for different mechanisms of precipitation across bacteria. The most fundamental difference was in ureolytic ability, where urease-positive bacteria caused rapid, widespread increases in pH, whereas nonureolytic strains produced such changes slowly and locally. These pH shifts correlated well with patterns of precipitation on solid medium. Strikingly, while both mechanisms led to high levels of precipitation, we observed clear differences in the precipitate. Ureolytic bacteria produced homogenous, inorganic fine crystals, whereas the crystals of nonureolytic strains were larger and had a mixed organic/inorganic composition. When representative strains were tested in application for crack healing in cement mortars, nonureolytic bacteria gave robust results, while ureolytic strains showed more variation. This may be explained by our observation that urease activity differed between growth conditions or by the different natures and therefore different material performances of the precipitates. Our results shed light on the breadth of biomineralization activity among environmental bacteria, an important step toward the rational design of bacterially based engineering solutions.IMPORTANCE Biomineralization triggered by bacteria is important in the natural environment and has many applications in industry and in civil and geotechnical engineering. The diversity in biomineralization capabilities of environmental bacteria is, however, not well understood. This study surveyed environmental bacteria for their ability to precipitate calcium carbonate minerals and investigated both the mechanisms and the resulting crystals. We show that while urease activity leads to the fastest precipitation, it is by no means essential. Importantly, the same quantities of calcium carbonate are produced by nonureolytic bacteria, and the resulting crystals appear to have larger volumes and more organic components, which are likely beneficial in specific applications. Testing both precipitation mechanisms in a self-healing concrete application showed that nonureolytic bacteria delivered more robust results. Here, we performed a systematic study of the fundamental differences in biomineralization between environmental bacteria, and we provide important information for the design of bacterially based engineering solutions.",False,0,,True,0

However, with upper age estimates of less than 110,000 years, the central cavity is too young compared to NGC 2244 and existing models do not reproduce its properties. A new proper motion study herein using Gaia data reveals the ejection of the most massive star in the Rosette, HD46223, from NGC 2244 occurred 1.73 (+0.34,-0.25)Myr (1$\sigma$ uncertainty) in the past. Assuming this ejection was at the birth of the most massive stars in NGC 2244, including the dominant centrally positioned HD46150, the age is set for the famous ionised region at more than ten times that derived for the cavity. Here, we are able to reproduce the structure of the Rosette Nebula, through simulation of mechanical stellar feedback from a 40M$_{\odot}$ star in a thin sheet-like molecular cloud. We form the 135,000M$_{\odot}$ cloud from thermally-unstable diffuse interstellar medium under the influence of a realistic background magnetic field with thermal/magnetic pressure equilibrium. Properties derived from a snapshot of the simulation at 1.5Myr, including cavity size, stellar age, magnetic field and resulting inclination to the line of sight, match those derived from observations. An elegant explanation is thus provided for the stark contrast in age estimates based on realistic diffuse ISM properties, molecular cloud formation and stellar wind feedback.",False,0,,True,0

However, to make QSDC a practical reality, we have to mitigate its reliance on quantum memory, its immediate communication interruption caused by eavesdropping and its low transmission reliability due to the heavy qubit losses. Hence a new QSDC protocol is proposed based on a sophisticated coded single-photon DL04 QSDC protocol to tackle the open challenges. In particular, quantum memory is dispensed with and a high-accuracy secrecy capacity estimate is derived for this protocol by conceiving dynamic joint encryption and error-control (JEEC) coding. We demonstrate that this quantum-memory-free DL04 QSDC (QMF-DL04 QSDC) protocol inches closer to the quantum channel's capacity and significantly improves the original DL04 QSDC's robustness. Moreover, a rate-compatible low-rate JEEC coding scheme is designed for the proposed framework, and the JEEC code advocated is shown to approach the secrecy capacity, despite tolerating an extremely high loss of qubits in the time-varying wiretap channel. Our simulations and experimental results demonstrate that the QMF-DL04 QSDC scheme significantly increases both the secure information rate and the communication distance of the original DL04 protocol.",False,0,,True,0

In addition to allowing utility companies to monitor the status of their network independently in autonomous fashion, data collected by smart meters as part of the wider advanced metering infrastructure, can be valuable for third parties, such as government authorities. The availability of the information, the granularity of the data, and the real-time nature of the smart meter, means that predictive analytics can be employed to profile consumers with high accuracy and approximate, for example, the number of individuals living in a house, the type of appliances being used, or the duration of occupancy, to name but a few applications. This paper presents a machine learning model comparison for unemployment prediction of single household occupants, based on features extracted from smart meter electricity readings. A number of nonlinear classifiers are compared, and benchmarked against a generalized linear model, and the results presented. To ensure the robustness of the classifiers, we use repeated cross validation. The results revealed that it is possible to predict employability status with Area Under Curve (AUC) = 74%, Sensitivity (SE) = 54% and Specificity (SP) = 83%, using a multilayer perceptron neural network with dropout, closely followed by the results produced by a distance weighted discrimination with polynomial kernel model.

Endocytic processes are therefore widely investigated in the context of drug delivery, and inhibitors of endocytic pathways have been used to provide information regarding uptake mechanisms of drug carrier materials. Here we describe studies in which two established inhibitors of clathrin dependent and independent endocytosis, chlorpromazine and methyl‐β‐cyclodextrin respectively, were employed to probe endocytic pathways of three cell lines chosen to represent tumour‐relevant or associated phenotypes: 3 T3 (fibroblasts), HCT 116 (colon cancer) and MGLVA‐1 (gastric cancer). For clathrin mediated endocytosis the data highlight that chlorpromazine inhibition of transferrin internalization, via clathrin dependent endocytosis, is cell and time dependent. We also show that inhibition of uptake is transient with a resumption of transferrin internalization after a maximal inhibition period. The same endocytosis inhibitors were used to probe the internalization of 50 and 100 nm carboxylated polystyrene nanoparticles (C‐PS‐NPs) as model drug delivery carriers. Flow cytometry data indicated that internalisation of C‐PS‐NPs varied considerably with the incubation time of cells with chlorpromazine or methyl‐β‐cyclodextrin, and that the effects were also markedly cell‐line dependent. These data highlight that the effects of endocytosis inhibitors on the internalisation pathways even of relatively simple nanoparticles are complex and interdependent. We suggest that mechanistic investigations of the endocytic processes which govern practical applications of nanoparticles for diagnostic and therapeutic applications should be considered on a cell, time and concentration basis.",False,0,,True,0

First of all, the coupling of buckling and creasing occurs at the dedicated region of the gel structure, which is attributed to the edge and surface instabilities resulted from structure-defined spatial nonuniformity of swelling. The subsequent developments of post-buckling morphologies and crease patterns collaboratively drive the structural transformation of the gel part from the ""open"" state to the ""closed"" state, thus realizing the function of gripping. By utilizing the multi-stimuli-responsive nature of the hydrogel, we recover the swollen gel structure to its initial state, enabling reproducible and cyclic shape evolution. The described soft gel structure capable of shape transformation brings a variety of advantages, such as easy to fabricate, large strain transformation, efficient actuation, and high strength-to-weight ratio, and is anticipated to provide guidance for future applications in soft robotics, flexible electronics, offshore engineering, and healthcare products.",False,0,,True,0

Adequate maternal folate consumption during pregnancy is essential for healthy fetal development and long‐term offspring health. The mechanisms underlying fetal programming are poorly understood, but are likely to involve gene regulation. Epigenetic marks, including DNA methylation, regulate gene expression and are modifiable by folate supply. We observed transcriptional changes in fetal liver in response to maternal folate depletion and hypothesized that these changes are concomitant with altered gene promoter methylation. Methods and results Female C57BL/6J mice were fed diets containing 2 or 0.4 mg folic acid/kg for 4 wk before mating and throughout pregnancy. At 17.5‐day gestation, genome‐wide gene expression and promoter methylation were measured by microarray analysis in male fetal livers. While 989 genes were differentially expressed, 333 promoters had altered methylation (247 hypermethylated, 86 hypomethylated) in response to maternal folate depletion. Only 16 genes had both expression and methylation changes. However, most methylation changes occurred in genomic regions neighboring expression changes. Conclusion In response to maternal folate depletion, altered expression at the mRNA level was not associated with altered promoter methylation of the same gene in fetal liver.",False,0,,True,0

This is achieved by substituting the stretch definition from the original interaction functions with a new stretch measure that we call modified stretch. The resultant interaction functions are proven to approximate the existing formulations, and proven to require equivalent stability and convergence conditions under explicit time integration. Gains of speed greater than 11% were obtained in numerical tests that compared the new functions with those in the literature. The new approach was verified against classical elastic theory using simple examples and shows good agreement. Examples describing three-dimensional quasi-brittle structures are also presented.

Here, we present a novel approach for deriving regular and consistent CFLs based on CryoSat-2 swath altimetry. The CFL detection is based on the premise that the shelf edge is usually characterized by a steep ice cliff, which is clearly resolved in the surface elevation data. Our method applies edge detection and vectorization of the sharp ice edge in gridded elevation data to generate vector shapefiles of the calving front. To show the feasibility of our approach, we derived a unique data set of ice-front positions for the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf (FRIS) between 2011 and 2018 at a 200 m spatial resolution and biannual temporal frequency. The observed CFLs compare well with independently derived ice front positions from Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery and are used to calculate area change, advance rates, and iceberg calving rates. We measure an area increase of 810 ± 40 km2 a−1 for FRIS and calving rates of 9 ± 1 Gt a−1 and 7 ± 1 Gt a−1 for the Filchner and Ronne Ice Shelves, respectively, which is an order of magnitude smaller than their steady-state calving flux. Our findings demonstrate that the “elevation-edge” method is complementary to standard CFL detection techniques. Although at a reduced spatial resolution and less suitable for smaller glaciers in steep terrain, it enables to provide CFLs at regular intervals and to fill existing gaps in time and space. Moreover, the method simultaneously provides ice thickness, required for mass budget calculation, and has a degree of automation which removes the need for heavy manual intervention. In the future, altimetry data has the potential to deliver a systematic and continuous record of change in ice shelf calving front positions around Antarctica. This will greatly benefit the investigation of environmental forcing on ice flow and terminus dynamics by providing a valuable climate data record and improving our knowledge of the constraints for calving models and ice shelf freshwater budget.",False,0,,True,0

Extratropical cyclones produce significant precipitation and the associated latent heat release can play a major role in their development. This study evaluates the ability of a climate model, HiGEM, to represent latent heating in extratropical cyclones. Remote sensing data is used to investigate the ability of both the climate model and ERA-Interim (ERAI) reanalysis to represent extratropical cyclone cloud features before latent heating itself is assessed. An offline radiance simulator, COSP, and the ISCCP and CloudSat datasets are used to evaluate comparable fields from HiGEM and ERAI. HiGEM is found to exhibit biases in the cloud structure of extratropical cyclones, with too much high cloud produced in the warm conveyor belt region compared to ISCCP. Significant latent heating occurs in this region, derived primarily from HiGEM's convection scheme. ERAI is also found to exhibit biases in cloud structure, with more clouds at lower altitudes than those observed in ISCCP in the warm conveyor belt region. As a result, latent heat release in ERAI is concentrated at lower altitudes. CloudSat indicates that much precipitation may be produced at too low an altitude in both HiGEM and ERAI, particularly ERAI, and neither capture observed variability in precipitation intensity. The potential vorticity structure in composite extratropical cyclones in HiGEM and ERAI is also compared. A more pronounced tropopause ridge evolves in HiGEM on the leading edge of the composite as compared to ERAI. One future area of research to be addressed is what impact these biases in the representation of latent heating have on climate projections produced by HiGEM. The biases found in ERAI indicate caution is required when using reanalyses to study cloud features and precipitation processes in extratropical cyclones or using reanalysis to evaluate climate models' ability to represent their structure.",False,0,,True,0

TES is a critical element and distinct advantage of solar-thermal systems. It can allow, depending on how it is implemented, improved matching to the end-user demands, improved load factors, higher average efficiencies and overall performance, as well as reduced component and system sizes and costs, especially in climates with high solar-irradiance variability. The operating temperature range of the TES solution must be compatible with the solar-collector array and with the ORC engine operation in order to maximise the overall performance of the system. Various combinations of phase change materials (PCMs) and solar collectors are compared and the S-CHP system’s performance is simulated for selected months in the contrasting climates of Cyprus and the UK. The most important performance indicator of the ORC engine, i.e., net-power output, and the required TES volume are compared and discussed. The PCM-TES solutions that enable the best summer performance from an ORC engine sized for a nominal ∼1-kWe output in combination with a 15-m2 solar collector array result in diurnal volume requirements as low as ∼100 L in Cyprus and 400–500 L in the UK. However, the required TES volume is strongly influenced by the choice of operational strategy for the system in matching the domestic load profiles. In a full-storage strategy in which electrical energy generation from the ORC engine is offset to match the week-day evening peak in demand, it is found that a ∼20% higher total daily electrical output per unit storage volume can be achieved with a PCM compared to water as a sensible storage medium. The isothermal operation of the PCMs during phase-change allows for smaller diurnal storage temperature swings and higher energy conversion efficiencies from the solar collector array. These results are useful in informing the development of small-scale solar-thermal heat and power systems and of suitable integrated TES solutions for such applications.",False,0,,True,0

Previous research has established a role for the cytosolic Tsa1 peroxiredoxin in responding to protein misfolding stress. Tsa1 is also known to downregulate the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway as part of the response to hydrogen peroxide stress. However, whether the cAMP/PKA pathway is involved in protein misfolding stress is not known. Using transcriptomics, we examined the response to protein misfolding stress and found upregulation of numerous stress gene functions and downregulation of many genes related to protein synthesis and other growth-related processes consistent with the well-characterized environmental stress response. The scope of the transcriptional response is largely similar in wild-type and tsa1 mutant strains, but the magnitude is dampened in the strain lacking Tsa1. We identified a direct protein interaction between Tsa1 and the Bcy1 regulatory subunit of PKA that is present under normal growth conditions and explains the observed differences in gene expression profiles. This interaction is increased in a redox-dependent manner in response to nascent protein misfolding, via Tsa1-mediated oxidation of Bcy1. Oxidation of Bcy1 causes a reduction in cAMP binding by Bcy1, which dampens PKA pathway activity, leading to a targeted reprogramming of gene expression. Redox regulation of the regulatory subunit of PKA provides a mechanism to mitigate the toxic consequences of protein misfolding stress that is distinct to stress caused by exogenous sources of reactive oxygen species.",False,0,,True,0

Insect herbivory could also explain the positive correlation between tree species richness and rainfall if herbivory increases with rainfall, is higher on locally abundant versus rare species, and is not limited by predation pressure at wet sites. To test these predictions, insect herbivory and predation pressure on insect herbivores were quantified across a Neotropical rainfall and tree species richness gradient, and herbivory was investigated in relation to local tree abundances. Insect herbivory on leaves (folivory) decreased strongly and significantly with rainfall, while predation pressure was significantly higher at the wetter site. Herbivores were more likely to attack abundant tree species, but herbivore damage levels were not related to tree species abundance. Insect folivores might contribute to local tree species coexistence in our system, but seem unlikely to drive the positive correlation between tree species richness and rainfall. The unexpected and contrasting patterns of herbivory and predation we observed support the need for a multi‐trophic perspective to understand fully the processes contributing to diversity and ecosystem functioning.",False,0,,True,0

Raised ASL glucose is associated with increased susceptibility to infection by respiratory pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We have previously shown that the anti-diabetes drug, metformin, reduces glucose-induced S. aureus growth across in vitro airway epithelial cultures. The aim of this study was to investigate whether metformin has the potential to reduce glucose-induced P. aeruginosa infections across airway epithelial (Calu-3) cultures by limiting glucose permeability. We also explored the effect of P. aeruginosa and metformin on airway epithelial barrier function by investigating changes in tight junction protein abundance. Apical P. aeruginosa growth increased with basolateral glucose concentration, reduced transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and increased paracellular glucose flux. Metformin pre-treatment of the epithelium inhibited the glucose-induced growth of P. aeruginosa, increased TEER and decreased glucose flux. Similar effects on bacterial growth and TEER were observed with the AMP activated protein kinase agonist, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide. Interestingly, metformin was able to prevent the P. aeruginosa-induced reduction in the abundance of tight junction proteins, claudin-1 and occludin. Our study highlights the potential of metformin to reduce hyperglycaemia-induced P. aeruginosa growth through airway epithelial tight junction modulation, and that claudin-1 and occludin could be important targets to regulate glucose permeability across airway epithelia and supress bacterial growth. Further investigation into the mechanisms regulating metformin and P. aeruginosa action on airway epithelial tight junctions could yield new therapeutic targets to prevent/suppress hyperglycaemia-induced respiratory infections, avoiding the use of antibiotics.",False,0,,True,0

NMR is uniquely suited to resolving atomic environments within complex molecular assemblies and reporting on membrane organisation, protein structure, lipid and polysaccharide composition, conformational variations and molecular interactions.

Gaia astrometry is available for 258 out of 433 members of the association, with revised Hipparcos astrometry used for the remainder. We use this data to confirm that the three subgroups of Sco-Cen are gravitationally unbound and have non-isotropic velocity dispersions, suggesting they have not had time to dynamically relax. We also explore the internal kinematics of the subgroups to search for evidence of expansion. We test Blaauw's classical linear model of expansion, search for velocity trends along the Galactic axes, compare the expanding and non-expanding convergence points, perform traceback analysis assuming both linear trajectories and using an epicycle approximation, and assess the evidence for expansion in proper motions corrected for virtual expansion / contraction. None of these methods provide coherent evidence for expansion of the subgroups, with no evidence to suggest that the subgroups had a more compact configuration in the past. We find evidence for kinematic substructure within the subgroups that supports the view that they were not formed by the disruption of individual star clusters.

With high-resolution three-dimensional numerical hydrodynamics simulations, we modeled the behavior of the VSI in protoplanetary disks with and without embedded planets. We then measured its accretion and mixing capabilities by comparing the full Reynolds stress, which includes the contribution of nonaxisymmetric features, such as spiral arms and vortices, to the Reynolds stress due to the azimuthally averaged velocity field, which can be attributed to good approximation to the VSI. We verified that the VSI can contribute to the accretion stress and showed that, depending on disk conditions, an embedded planet can coexist with or suppress VSI turbulent stress. Specifically, the presence of spiral shocks launched by a planet or planet-generated vortices can interfere with the VSI near the planet’s vicinity, with the instability recovering at large enough distances from the planet or vortex.

Computational differences between these two mechanisms suggest that they may be implemented in visual pathways with different spatial and temporal resolutions. Here, we used fMRI to examine how achromatic and S-cone signals contribute to human MID perception. Both CD and IOVD stimuli evoked responses in a widespread network that included early visual areas, parts of the dorsal and ventral streams, and motion-selective area hMT+. Crucially, however, we measured an interaction between MID type and chromaticity. fMRI CD responses were largely driven by achromatic stimuli, but IOVD responses were better driven by isoluminant S-cone inputs. In our psychophysical experiments, when S-cone and achromatic stimuli were matched for perceived contrast, participants were equally sensitive to the MID in achromatic and S-cone IOVD stimuli. In comparison, they were relatively insensitive to S-cone CD. These findings provide evidence that MID mechanisms asymmetrically draw on information in precortical pathways. An early opponent motion signal optimally conveyed by the S-cone pathway may provide a substantial contribution to the IOVD mechanism.",False,0,,True,0

The simulations consist of setting up a shear flow by confining the lubricant between iron oxide surfaces. By using confined Non-Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics (NEMD) simulations at a pressure range of 0.1-1.0 GPa at 100 °C, we demonstrate that the film thickness of the fluid affects the behaviour of viscosity. We find that by increasing the number of lubricant molecules, we approach the viscosity value of the bulk fluid derived from previously published NEMD simulations for the same system. These changes in viscosity occurred at film thicknesses ranging from 10.12 to 55.93 Å. The viscosity deviations at different pressures between the system with the greatest number of lubricant molecules and the bulk simulations varied from -16% to 41%.

This article makes the case for an expansion of research in three areas: sites, modes and scales of remembering. First, the article argues for an examination of less researched heritage sites alongside considering non-site-based forms of memory production. Second, we contend that memory-making in tourism can contribute to a ‘positive turn’ in memory studies by foregrounding memories of joy and entertainment. Finally, we argue for a multiscalar perspective that draws attention to personal memories and memory’s interscalar movements in tourism.

However, there is little information for tropical forest soils, which presents a challenge for δ 18 O P measurements due to low available P concentrations. Here we report the use of a rapid ammonium fluoride extraction method (Bray‐1) as an alternative to the widely used anion‐exchange membrane (AEM) method for quantification of δ 18 O P values of available P in tropical forest soils. Methods We compared P concentrations and δ 18 O P values of available and microbial P determined by AEM and Bray‐1 extraction for a series of tropical forest soils from Panama spanning a steep P gradient. This involved an assessment of the influence of extraction conditions, including temperature, extraction time, fumigation time and solution‐to‐soil ratio, on P concentrations and isotope ratios. Results Depending on the extraction conditions, Bray‐1 P concentrations ranged from 0.2 to 66.3 mg P kg −1 across the soils. Extraction time and temperature had only minor effects on Bray‐1 P, but concentrations increased markedly as the solution‐to‐soil ratio increased. In contrast, extraction conditions did not affect Bray‐1 δ 18 O P values, indicating that Bray‐1 provides a robust measure of the isotopic composition of available soil P. For a relatively high P soil, available and fumigation‐released (microbial) δ 18 O P values determined by Bray‐1 extraction (20‰ and 16‰, respectively) were higher than those determined by the AEM method (18‰ and 12‰, respectively), which we attribute to slightly different P pools extracted by the two methods and/or differences resulting from the longer extraction time needed for the AEM method. Conclusions The short extraction time, insensitivity to extraction conditions and smaller mass of soil required to extract sufficient P for isotopic analysis make Bray‐1extraction a suitable alternative to the AEM method for the determination of δ 18 O P values of available P in tropical soils.",False,0,,True,1

One of the most significant challenges to snowball Earth has been sedimentological cyclicity that has been taken to imply more climate dynamics than expected when the ocean is completely covered in ice. However, recent climate models suggest that as atmospheric CO 2 accumulates, the snowball climate system becomes sensitive to orbital forcing. Here we show the presence of nearly all Milankovitch (orbital) cycles preserved in stratified banded iron formation deposited during the Sturtian snowball Earth. These results provide evidence for orbitally forced cyclicity of global ice sheets that resulted in periodic oxidation of ferrous iron. Orbital glacial advance and retreat cycles provide a simple mechanism to reconcile both the sedimentary dynamics and the enigmatic survival of multicellular life during snowball Earth.",False,0,,True,0

The term “representativeness” is intended to include diversity, but for numerical reasons (and the likelihood of being able to perform a QSAR) it is necessary to focus on areas of chemical space that are more highly populated. Encoding chemical structures as fingerprints using the RDKit “patterned” algorithm, we first assess the granularity of the natural products space using a simple clustering algorithm, showing that there are major regions of “denseness” but also a great many very sparsely populated areas. We then apply a “hybrid” hierarchical K‐means clustering algorithm to the data to produce more statistically robust clusters from which representative and appropriate numbers of samples may be chosen. There is necessarily again a trade‐off between cluster size and cluster number, but within these constraints, libraries containing 384 or 1152 molecules can be found that come from clusters that represent some 18 and 30% of the whole chemical space, with cluster sizes of, respectively, 50 and 27 or above, just about sufficient to perform a QSAR. By using the online availability of molecules via the Molport system ( www.molport.com ), we are also able to construct (and, for the first time, provide the contents of) a small virtual library of available molecules that provided effective coverage of the chemical space described. Consistent with this, the average molecular similarities of the contents of the libraries developed is considerably smaller than is that of the original libraries. The suggested libraries may have use in molecular or phenotypic screening, including for determining possible transporter substrates.",False,0,,True,0

In this work we present an alternative method, which aims to find a middle ground between the two. Specifically, we have implemented an approach in the multiwavelet madness molecular DFT code that permits a combination of atoms treated at the AE and pseudopotential (PSP) level. Atoms for which one wishes to calculate the core edges are thus treated at an AE level, while the remainder can be treated at the PSP level. This is made possible thanks to the multiresolution approach of madness, which permits accurate and efficient calculations at both the AE and PSP level.

The solar atmosphere is a potential site for this process to occur with interaction between either prominence or spicule material and the solar corona allowing the development of transition region material with enhanced radiative losses. In this paper, we derive a set of equations to model the evolution of such a mixing layer and make predictions for the mixing-driven cooling rate and the rate at which mixing can lead to the condensation of the coronal material. These theoretical predictions are benchmarked against 2.5D MHD simulations. Applying the theoretical scalings to prominence threads or fading spicules, we found that as a mixing layer grows on their boundaries this would lead to the creation of transition region material with a cooling time of ∼100 s, explaining the warm emission observed as prominence threads or spicules fade in cool spectral lines without the requirement for any heating. For quiescent prominences, dynamic condensation driven by the mixing process could restore ∼18 per cent of the mass lost from a prominence through downflows. Overall, this mechanism of thermal energy loss through radiative losses induced by mixing highlights the importance for considering dynamical interaction between material at different temperatures when trying to understand the thermodynamic evolution of the cool material in the solar corona.",False,0,,True,0

This study examines observed changes in BPWs during the northern winter resulting from enhanced solar forcing and the consequent effect on the seasonal development of the polar vortex. During the period 1979–2014, solar-induced changes in BPWs were first observed in the uppermost stratosphere. High solar forcing was marked by sharpening of the potential vorticity (PV) gradient at 30°–45°N, enhanced wave absorption at high latitudes, and a reduced PV gradient between these regions. These anomalies instigated an equatorward shift of the upper-stratospheric waveguide and enhanced downward wave reflection at high latitudes. The equatorward refraction of reflected waves from the polar upper stratosphere then led to enhanced wave absorption at 35°–45°N and 7–20 hPa, indicative of a widening of the midstratospheric surf zone. The stratospheric waveguide was thus constricted at about 45°–60°N and 5–10 hPa in early boreal winter; reduced upward wave propagation through this region resulted in a stronger upper-stratospheric westerly jet. From January, the regions with enhanced BPWs acted as “barriers” for subsequent upward and equatorward wave propagation. As the waves were trapped within the stratosphere, anomalies of zonal wavenumbers 2 and 3 were reflected poleward from the stratospheric surf zone. Resonant excitation of some of these reflected waves resulted in rapid growth of wave disturbances and a more disturbed polar vortex in late winter. These results provide a process-oriented explanation for the observed solar cycle signal. They also highlight the importance of nonlinearity in the processes that drive the stratospheric response to external forcing.",False,0,,True,0

Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) is a widely used technique for in situ U–Pb geochronology of accessory minerals. Existing algorithms for SIMS data reduction and error propagation make a number of simplifying assumptions that degrade the precision and accuracy of the resulting U–Pb dates. This paper uses an entirely new approach to SIMS data processing that introduces the following improvements over previous algorithms. First, it treats SIMS measurements as compositional data using log-ratio statistics. This means that, unlike existing algorithms, (a) its isotopic ratio estimates are guaranteed to be strictly positive numbers, (b) identical results are obtained regardless of whether data are processed as normal ratios (e.g. 206Pb / 238U) or reciprocal ratios (e.g. 238U / 206Pb), and (c) its uncertainty estimates account for the positive skewness of measured isotopic ratio distributions. Second, the new algorithm accounts for the Poisson noise that characterises secondary electron multiplier (SEM) detectors. By fitting the SEM signals using the method of maximum likelihood, it naturally handles low-intensity ion beams, in which zero-count signals are common. Third, the new algorithm casts the data reduction process in a matrix format and thereby captures all sources of systematic uncertainty. These include significant inter-spot error correlations that arise from the Pb / U–UO(2) / U calibration curve. The new algorithm has been implemented in a new software package called simplex. The simplex package was written in R and can be used either online, offline, or from the command line. The programme can handle SIMS data from both Cameca and SHRIMP instruments.",False,0,,True,0

Using temperature dependent emission, time‐resolved spectroscopy, white‐light reflectivity, and measurements of fluorescence quantum yield, the population of polaritons is explored along the lower polariton branch. It is found that both the cavity fluorescence quantum efficiency and the distribution of polariton states along the lower polariton branch is a function of exciton–photon detuning. Importantly, it is shown that in the most negatively detuned cavities, the emission quantum efficiency approaches that of a control (noncavity) film. A simple fitting model is developed, which is based upon direct radiative pumping of polariton states along the lower polariton branch and used it to obtain an excellent agreement with measured photoluminescence as a function of temperature and exciton–photon detuning, and qualitative agreement with the measured photoluminescence quantum efficiency. The radiative pumping mechanism indicates that to facilitate the formation of a nonequilibrium polariton condensate in strongly‐coupled microcavities containing dispersed molecular dyes, it is important to utilize materials having high fluorescent quantum efficiency and fast radiative rates.",False,0,,True,0

We measure the surface mass density from a weak-lensing analysis and characterize the overall matter distribution in both the cluster and parallel fields. The surface mass distribution derived for the parallel field shows clumpy overdensities connected by filament-like structures elongated in the direction of the cluster core. We also characterize the X-ray emission in the parallel field and compare it with the lensing mass distribution. We identify five mass peaks at the &amp;gt;5σ level over the two fields, four of them being in the cluster one. Three of them are located close to galaxy overdensities and one is also close to an excess in the X-ray emission. Nevertheless, two of them have neither optical nor X-ray counterpart and are located close to the edges of the field of view, thus further studies are needed to confirm them as substructures. Finally, we compare our results with the predicted subhalo distribution of one of the Hydrangea/C-EAGLE simulated cluster. Significant differences are obtained suggesting the simulated cluster is at a more advanced evolutionary stage than MACS J0416.1−2403. Our results anticipate the upcoming BUFFALO observations that will link the two HFF fields, extending further the HST coverage.",False,0,,True,0

Most musculoskeletal modelling work has to date focused on humans or their close relatives, with few examples of quadrupedal animal limb models. A musculoskeletal model of the mouse hindlimb could have broad utility for questions in medicine, genetics, locomotion and neuroscience. This is due to this species' position as a premier model of human disease, having an array of genetic tools for manipulation of the animal in vivo, and being a small quadruped, a category for which few models exist. Here, the methods used to develop the first three-dimensional (3D) model of a mouse hindlimb and pelvis are described. The model, which represents bones, joints and 39 musculotendon units, was created through a combination of previously gathered muscle architecture data from microdissections, contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography (CT) scanning and digital segmentation. The model allowed muscle moment arms as well as muscle forces to be estimated for each musculotendon unit throughout a range of joint rotations. Moment arm analysis supported the reliability of musculotendon unit placement within the model, and comparison to a previously published rat hindlimb model further supported the model's reliability. A sensitivity analysis performed on both the force-generating parameters and muscle's attachment points of the model indicated that the maximal isometric muscle moment is generally most sensitive to changes in either tendon slack length or the coordinates of insertion, although the degree to which the moment is affected depends on several factors. This model represents the first step in the creation of a fully dynamic 3D computer model of the mouse hindlimb and pelvis that has application to neuromuscular disease, comparative biomechanics and the neuromechanical basis of movement. Capturing the morphology and dynamics of the limb, it enables future dissection of the complex interactions between the nervous and musculoskeletal systems as well as the environment.",False,0,,True,0

The ATPase activity of the Escherichia coli SMC protein, MukB, which is essential for its in vivo function, requires its interaction with the dimeric kleisin, MukF that in turn interacts with the KITE protein, MukE.

The development of cloud-based quantum computing devices enables us to explore the limits of macrorealism in new regimes. In particular, here we take advantage of the properties of the programmable nature of the IBM quantum experience to observe the violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality (in the form of a ``quantum witness"") as a function of the number of constituent systems (qubits), while simultaneously maximizing the `disconnectivity', a potential measure of macroscopicity, between constituents. Our results show that two-qubit and four-qubit ``cat states"" (which have large disconnectivity) are seen to violate the inequality, and hence can be classified as nonmacrorealistic. In contrast, a six-qubit cat state does not violate the ``quantum-witness"" beyond a so-called clumsy invasive-measurement bound, and thus is compatible with ``clumsy macrorealism"".

First we approximate the $p$-norm penalization term as a sequence of $2$-norm penalization terms using adaptive regularization matrices in an iterative reweighted norm fashion, and then we exploit flexible preconditioning techniques to efficiently incorporate the weight updates. To handle general (nonsquare) $\ell_p$-regularized least-squares problems, we introduce a flexible Golub--Kahan approach and exploit it within a Krylov--Tikhonov hybrid framework. Furthermore, we show that both the flexible Golub--Kahan and the flexible Arnoldi approaches for $p=1$ can be used to efficiently compute solutions that are sparse with respect to some transformations. The key benefits of our approach compared to existing optimization methods for $\ell_p$ regularization are that inner-outer iteration schemes are replaced by efficient projection methods on linear subspaces of increasing dimension and that expensive regularization parameter selection techniques can be avoided. Theoretical insights are provided, and numerical results from image deblurring and tomographic reconstruction illustrate the benefits of this approach, compared to well-established methods.",False,0,,True,0

These oscillations arise due to the superposition of the prograde and retrograde frequencies.

However, a common bottleneck for industrial adoption of such techniques is the needs for interactive proofs. We use a popular formal method, called Event-B , as our working domain, and set invariant preservation (INV) proofs as targets, because INV proofs can account for a significant proportion of the proofs requiring human interactions. We apply an inductive theorem proving technique, called rippling, for Event-B INV proofs. Rippling automates proofs using meta-level guidance. The guidance is in particular useful to develop proof patches to recover failed proof attempts. We are interested in the case when a missing lemma is required. We combine a scheme-based theory-exploration system, called IsaScheme [ MRMDB10 ], with rippling to develop a proof patch via lemma discovery. We also develop two new proof patches to unfold operator definitions and to suggest case-splits, respectively. The combined use of rippling with these three proof patches as a proof method significantly improves the proof automation for our evaluation set.",False,0,,True,0

Models that can predict such turbulence could reduce measurement costs. We compare a Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS) simulation with acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) measurements from a highly-energetic tidal site. This comparison shows the extent to which turbulence can be quantified by ROMS, using the conventional k−ε turbulence closure model. Both model and observations covered the same time period, encompassing two spring-neap cycles. Turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) density was calculated from measurements using the variance method; turbulent dissipation, ε, was calculated using the structure function method. Measurements show that wave action dominates turbulent fluctuations in the upper half of the water column; comparing results for deeper water, however, shows very strong agreement. A best fit between ROMS and ADCP results for mean velocity yields R2=0.98; for TKE, R2 is 0.84 when strongly wave-dominated times are excluded. Dissipation agrees less well: although time series of ε are well-correlated at similar depths, ROMS estimates a greater magnitude of dissipation than is measured, by a factor of up to 4.8.",False,0,,True,0

This paper presents the study of wake flow and aerodynamics of an oscillating square cylinder at the resonant frequency in freestream turbulence, with the integral length not greater than the cylinder side and the turbulence intensity not greater than 10%. Large eddy simulations (LES) in the Cartesian grid using the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) technique embedded in a FVM solver, together with an efficient synthetic turbulent inflow generator implemented in an in-house parallel FORTRAN code are used for the study. The results are compared with those for smooth inflow, and relevant data published in the literature. The key findings are: the freestream turbulence conditions evidently reduces the local turbulent scales and fluctuations in the shear layer compared to in smooth flow, as small scale freestream turbulence breaks down cylinder-generated larger scale eddies and weakens them; but does not evidently affect the vortex shedding frequency, or the length of the recirculation region behind the cylinder. This suggests negligible change of drag coefficient compared to in smooth inflow. Moreover, this is because the vortex shedding is dominated by the forced oscillation at the resonance frequency, and the turbulence intensity is small.",False,0,,True,0

Typical symptoms are behavioural abnormalities including motor deficits that mark disease progression, while non-motor symptoms and synaptic deficits are already apparent during the early stages of disease. Synucleinopathies have therefore been considered synaptopathies that exhibit synaptic dysfunction prior to neurodegeneration. However, the mechanisms and events underlying synaptopathy are largely unknown. Here we investigated the cascade of pathological events underlying α-syn accumulation and toxicity in a Drosophila model of synucleinopathy by employing a combination of histological, biochemical, behavioural and electrophysiological assays. Our findings demonstrate that targeted expression of human α-syn leads to its accumulation in presynaptic terminals that caused downregulation of synaptic proteins, cysteine string protein, synapsin, and syntaxin 1A, and a reduction in the number of Bruchpilot puncta, the core component of the presynaptic active zone essential for its structural integrity and function. These α-syn-mediated presynaptic alterations resulted in impaired neuronal function, which triggered behavioural deficits in ageing Drosophila that occurred prior to progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Comparable alterations in presynaptic active zone protein were found in patient brain samples of dementia with Lewy bodies. Together, these findings demonstrate that presynaptic accumulation of α-syn impairs the active zone and neuronal function, which together cause synaptopathy that results in behavioural deficits and the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons. This sequence of events resembles the cytological and behavioural phenotypes that characterise the onset and progression of synucleinopathies, suggesting that α-syn-mediated synaptopathy is an initiating cause of age-related neurodegeneration.",False,0,,True,0

IL‐23 binds to a receptor complex composed of two single transmembrane spanning proteins IL23R and IL12Rβ1. In this study, we aimed to gain further understanding of how ligand binding induces signalling of IL‐23 receptor complexes using the proximity‐based techniques of NanoLuc Binary Technology (NanoBiT) and Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET). Experimental Approach To monitor the formation of IL‐23 receptor complexes, we developed a split luciferase (NanoBiT) assay whereby heteromerisation of receptor subunits can be measured through luminescence. The affinity of NanoBiT complemented complexes for IL‐23 was measured using NanoBRET, and cytokine‐induced signal transduction was measured using a phospho‐STAT3 AlphaLISA assay. Key Results NanoBiT measurements demonstrated that IL‐23 receptor complexes formed to an equal degree in the presence and absence of ligand. NanoBRET measurements confirmed that these complexes bound IL‐23 with a picomolar binding affinity. Measurement of STAT3 phosphorylation demonstrated that pre‐formed IL‐23 receptor complexes induced signalling following ligand binding. It was also demonstrated that synthetic ligand‐independent signalling could be induced by high affinity (HiBit) but not low affinity (SmBit) NanoBiT crosslinking of the receptor N‐ terminal domains. Conclusions and Implications These results indicate that receptor complexes form prior to ligand binding and are not sufficient to induce signalling alone. Our findings indicate that IL‐23 induces a conformational change in heteromeric receptor complexes, to enable signal transduction. These observations have direct implications for drug discovery efforts to target the IL‐23 receptor.",False,0,,True,1

At the 50th cycle the specific capacity is 638 mAh g −1 for reduction and 593 mAh g −1 for oxidation. This capacity is demonstrated for tin sulfide itself without the need for a nanostructured carbon support, unlike previous high capacity SnS anodes in the literature. Both the capacity and ex situ characterization experiments indicate a conversion reaction producing tin, followed by alloying with sodium during reduction, and that both of these processes are reversible during oxidation.",False,0,,True,0

The Craugastor punctariolus species series of direct developing frogs is endemic to the region and used to be comprised of 33 species, seven of which have known populations at present. One of these, C. ranoides , endemic to southern Nicaragua and Costa Rica, was historically found in cloud forest sites of Área de Conservación Guanacaste (ACG) in north‐west Costa Rica and extended into dry forest sites 20 km distant. Here, C. ranoides declined and disappeared from high elevation sites between the mid‐1980s and early 1990s, but populations persisted in the lowland dry forest. We compared the genetic richness and ranavirus infection status of C. ranoides from extant dry forest populations to historic museum specimens of now extinct ACG cloud forest populations using DNA sequence diversity at two mitochondrial loci and molecular screening for ranavirus. Extant dry forest populations of C. ranoides formed a monophyletic group which included historic specimens sampled at cloud forest sites. However, the extirpated ACG cloud forest population contained additional diversity: samples formed a divergent clade with unknown spatial distribution. Ranavirus was detected in both current and museum samples of C. ranoides and sequences from a 267‐nucleotide region of the major capsid protein gene shared 100% sequence identity with one another and with Frog virus 3 . Our findings document cryptic diversity within an endangered species that has demonstrated no recovery in cloud forests and raises questions about Ranavirus and its potential link to the amphibian declines in this system. The presence of the same C. ranoides clade within present day and historical samples suggests a potential for effective translocation and repopulation of extirpated cloud forest populations.",False,0,,True,0

At strong coupling, a proliferation of complex conjugated branch cuts renders a causal representation impossible.

However, all endemic terrestrial mammals on the Cayman Islands are now extinct, following post-1500 AD human colonization of the islands. Introduced rodents and domesticated mammals now exclusively represent this facet of terrestrial fauna on the Cayman Islands, and are a likely cause of endemic species loss on the islands. Cayman Brac has numerous caves and rock fissures that offer protection to a naturally accumulated ensemble of vertebrate sub-fossil bone remains, documenting modifications in island biodiversity through the Holocene. In this study, we showcase the first molecular faunal survey undertaken on sub-fossil remains from the Cayman Islands, using collagen fingerprinting for taxonomic identification of the cave skeletal deposits collected from a single cave system, Green Cave on Cayman Brac. Collagen type (I) extracts from 485 bone fragments were analyzed to determine faunal identity and assemblage composition. A total of 76% of the collagen fingerprint-yielding samples were mammalian in origin, 67% of which were identified as invasive murid rodents. Here, we present mass spectral biomarkers for the endemic terrestrial mammal fauna of Cayman Brac, including the extinct capromyid rodents, Capromys and Geocapromys (Rodentia: Capromyidae), alongside commentary on the composition of the sub-fossil bone assemblage between the five distinct depositional chambers that comprise Green Cave.

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have long held the promise to revolutionize filtration, with orders of magnitude higher fluxes compared to commercial membranes. CNTs, however, can only reject particles and ions wider than their internal diameter. In this work, the fabrication of aligned boron nitride nanotube (BNNT) membranes capable of rejecting nanoparticles smaller than their internal diameter is reported for the first time. This is due to a mechanism of charge-based rejection in addition to the size-based one, enabled by the BNNTs surface structure and chemistry and elucidated here using high fidelity molecular dynamics and Brownian dynamics simulations. This results in ∼40% higher rejection of the same particles by BNNT membranes than CNT ones with comparable nanotube diameter. Furthermore, since permeance is proportional to the square of the nanotubes' diameter, using BNNT membranes with ∼30% larger nanotube diameter than a CNT membrane with comparable rejection would result in up to 70% higher permeance. These results open the way to the design of more effective nanotube membranes, capable of high particle rejection and, at the same time, high water permeance.",False,0,,True,0

Linear theory with a spectral representation of topography is typically used to inform parameterizations of lee wave generation. Here, we use a realistic wave resolving simulation of the Drake Passage, a hot‐spot of lee wave generation, to investigate the utility of such parameterizations for areas of complex large scale topography. The flow is often blocked and split by large amplitude topographic features, creating an “effective topography,” and calling into question the spectral representation of small scale topography for lee wave generation. By comparing the resolved modeled wavefield to parameterizations employing various representations of topography, we show that spectral methods may not be appropriate in areas of rough topography. We develop a simple topographic representation consisting of an ensemble of topographic peaks, which allows physical treatment of flow blocking at finite amplitude topography. This method effectively predicts bottom vertical velocities and lee wave energy flux, whereas spectral methods overestimate the energy flux by approximately 4 times. Our results also imply that the nature of lee waves in such regions can be misrepresented by a spectral approach to topographic representation. This leads to both an overestimate of wave energy flux and an underestimate of wave nonlinearity, with implications for the mechanisms by which lee waves break and mix in the abyssal ocean.",False,0,,True,0

Here, we report that sigma viruses that infect Mediterranean fruit flies ( Ceratitis capitata ), Drosophila immigrans , and speckled wood butterflies ( Pararge aegeria ) are all vertically transmitted. We find patterns of vertical transmission that are consistent with those seen in Drosophila sigma viruses, with high rates of maternal transmission, and lower rates of paternal transmission. This mode of transmission allows them to spread rapidly in populations, and using viral sequence data we found the viruses in D. immigrans and C. capitata had both recently swept through host populations. The viruses were common in nature, with mean prevalences of 12% in C. capitata , 38% in D. immigrans and 74% in P. aegeria .

However, the method of delivery and tissue specificity remain the main hurdles of these approaches. Exosomes are natural carriers of functional small RNAs and proteins, representing an area of increasing interest in the field of drug delivery. It has been demonstrated that the exosome cargo, especially miRNAs, is at least partially responsible for the therapeutic effects of exosomes. Exosomes deliver their luminal content to the recipient cells and can be used as vesicles for the therapeutic delivery of RNAs and proteins. Synthetic therapeutic drugs can also be encapsulated into exosomes as they have a hydrophilic core, which makes them suitable to carry water-soluble drugs. In addition, engineered exosomes can display a variety of surface molecules, such as peptides, to target specific cells in tissues. The exosome properties present an added advantage to the targeted delivery of therapeutics, leading to increased efficacy and minimizing the adverse side effects. Furthermore, exosomes are natural nanoparticles found in all cell types and as a result, they do not elicit an immune response when administered. Exosomes have also demonstrated decreased long-term accumulation in tissues and organs and thus carry a low risk of systemic toxicity. This review aims to discuss all the advances in exosome therapies in ophthalmology and to give insight into the challenges that would need to be overcome before exosome therapies can be translated into clinical practice.",False,0,,True,1

The article argues that literary translation can be connected with the cultivation of good political relations at the highest levels, as well as with the promotion of Sino-African friendship and of a positive view of China.

Specifically, we examined the trajectory, transparency, and diversity of these preprints as compared to PsyArXiv preprints unrelated to COVID-19 (n = 167) and articles published in psychology journal articles (n = 75) within the same time frame. Preprints related to COVID-19 had similar traction to published journal articles on COVID-19, but compared to preprints unrelated to COVID-19, the COVID-19 preprints were more likely to be subsequently published during a follow-up period (until 2 March 2021), were published more quickly, and received more citations. Preprints related to COVID-19 reported fewer open science practices than preprints unrelated to COVID-19, but more than COVID-19 journal articles. Primary affiliations for all preprints and journal articles predominantly originated from Western countries, but this was comparatively more for preprints (both related to and not related to COVID-19), even though preprints had more international authorship teams than journal articles. In conclusion, this study sheds light on preprint dissemination within the field of psychology amid the COVID-19 crisis, emphasising the swift spread, heightened probability of subsequent publication, and diverse adherence to open science practices among COVID-19-related preprints.

However, little is known about the extent of inequality between people with and without disabilities in contexts where the majority of persons experience extreme poverty and hardship. This includes in Liberia, where very little is understood about the lives of disabled people in general. This study uses a multidimensional wellbeing framework to understand perceived relative inequality associated with disability by assessing several facets of wellbeing across and within households containing disabled members (N = 485) or households with no disabled members (N = 538) in Liberian communities (Total individuals surveyed, N = 2020). Statistical comparisons (adjusted for age, sex, education and wealth differences and clustered at the household, village and county level) reveal that disabled Liberians are managing similarly to non-disabled Liberians in terms of income and education, but experience many perceived relative inequalities including in life satisfaction, transport access, political participation and social inclusion. Our results further suggest that disability may lead to perceived relative inequality at the household level in terms of trust held in neighbours. However, they also show that being the head of a household may protect against perceived relative inequality in certain dimensions (e.g. healthcare and transport access, political participation) irrespective of disability status. Results are discussed in terms of practical implications for development efforts in Liberia and for disabled people in other low- and middle-income settings.",False,0,,True,0

G4s within some neuronal mRNAs are known to control distal localisation and local translation, contributing to distinct local proteomes that facilitate the synaptic remodelling attributed to normal cellular function. In this study, we characterise the G4 formation of a (GGN)13 repeat found within the 5′ UTR of the potassium 2-pore domain leak channel Task3 mRNA. Biophysical analyses show that this (GGN)13 repeat forms a parallel G4 in vitro exhibiting the stereotypical potassium specificity of G4s, remaining thermostable under physiological ionic conditions. Through mouse brain tissue G4-RNA immunoprecipitation, we further confirm that Task3 mRNA forms a G4 structure in vivo. The G4 is inhibitory to translation of Task3 in vitro and is overcome through activity of a G4-specific helicase DHX36, increasing K+ leak currents and membrane hyperpolarisation in HEK293 cells. Further, we observe that this G4 is fundamental to ensuring delivery of Task3 mRNA to distal primary cortical neurites. It has been shown that aberrant Task3 expression correlates with neuronal dysfunction, we therefore posit that this G4 is important in regulated local expression of Task3 leak channels that maintain K+ leak within neurons.",False,0,,True,0

To understand this better we considered whether lifestyle factors not included in the FRAX algorithm and psychosocial factors (social isolation, self-efficacy, or mental health status) explain the relationship between SPR and fracture. Methods We studied 146 UK community-dwelling older adults from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study. SPR ranked as ‘lower’, ‘similar’ and ‘higher’ relative to others of the same age, was assessed by questionnaire. Social isolation was assessed using the six-item Lubben Social Network Scale; self-efficacy was assessed using a shortened General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE); mental health status was assessed using the anxiety/depression item from the EuroQoL questionnaire. SPR in relation to previous self-reported fracture was examined using logistic regression. Results Among participants of median age 83.4 (IQR 81.5–85.5) years, SPR was lower for 54.1% of participants, similar for 30.8%, and higher for 15.1%; 74.7% reported no previous fractures. Greater SPR was associated with increased odds of previous fractures when adjusting for sex and age only (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.03–2.87, per higher band of SPR). While further individual adjustment for social isolation (1.73, 1.04–2.89), self-efficacy (1.71, 1.02–2.85), or mental health (1.77, 1.06–2.97) did not attenuate the relationship, individual adjustment for diet quality and number of comorbidities did. Conclusions Adjustment for social isolation, self-efficacy or mental health status did not attenuate the relationship between SPR and fracture. By contrast, lifestyle factors not included in FRAX, such as diet quality, did attenuate relationships, suggesting a possible future area of investigation.",False,0,,True,1

These molecules are chosen as examples of different spectral ranges (IR and UV), molecular types (diatomics and polyatomics) and spectral types (electronic and ro-vibrational); the importance of different vibrational bands in forming distinct non-LTE spectral features are investigated. Most notably, such key spectral signatures for distinguishing between the LTE and non-LTE cases include: for CH4 the 3.15 $\mu$m band region; for H2O the 2.0 $\mu$m and 2.7 $\mu$m band regions; for TiO, a strong variation in intensity in the bands between 0.5 and 0.75 $\mu$m; and a sole CO signature between 5 and 6 $\mu$m. The analysis is based on the ExoMol cross sections and takes advantage of the extensive vibrational assignment of these molecular line lists in the ExoMol database. We examine LTE and non-LTE cross sections under conditions consistent with those on WASP-12b and WASP-76b using the empirically motivated bi-temperature Treanor model. In addition, we make a simplistic forward model simulation of transmission spectra for H2O in the atmosphere of WASP-12b using the TauREx 3 atmospheric modelling code.",False,0,,True,0

It allows people to reorganize activities in time and space. Due to its important policy implications, a body of empirical research has emerged to examine the relationship between Internet use and travel behaviour, spanning several decades. One of the less researched areas is where people use the Internet and how this relates to the use of different transport modes. Recently, this relationship might have become more complicated due to the coronavirus pandemic changing the extent to which people use the Internet and travel. Since future outbreaks are highly likely to happen, understanding the changes in this relationship during this unprecedented time is critical to make more resilient transport plans. This study utilized three-years of National Travel Survey data in the UK and statistical models to address two research question: (1) Does using the Internet at home or on the move for non-work purposes generate additional non-commute trips by car or public transport?; and (2) did this relationship changed during the COVID-19 pandemic? Our results showed that, although the total number of trips significantly reduced in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, frequent Internet users generated more trips, and the location of Internet use mattered, even during the pandemic. People who frequently used the Internet at home generated more trips by car, while those who used the Internet on the move had more public transport trips. However, people who used the Internet more often at home or on the move during the COVID-19 pandemic generated more trips in total, and more car trips for non-commuting purposes compared to those who used the Internet less frequently. Our results revealed an important role of ICTs in travel demand during the pandemic and raises potential social exclusion issues.",False,0,,True,0

The Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO) at ca. 40 Ma is one of the largest of the transient Eocene global warming events. However, it is relatively poorly known from tropical settings since few sites span the entirety of the MECO event and/or host calcareous microfossils, which are the dominant proxy carrier for palaeoceanographic reconstructions. Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Pacific Ocean Site 865 in the low-latitude North Pacific (Allison Guyot) has the potential to provide a useful tropical MECO reference, but detailed stratigraphic and chronological constraints needed to evaluate its completeness were previously lacking. We have addressed this deficit by generating new high-resolution biostratigraphic, stable isotope, and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) records spanning the MECO interval (∼38.0–43.0 Ma) in two holes drilled at Site 865. XRF-derived strontium ∕ calcium (Sr∕Ca) and barium ∕ strontium (Ba∕Sr) ratios and Fe count records allow correlation between holes and reveal pronounced rhythmicity, enabling us to develop the first composite section for Holes 865B and 865C and a preliminary cyclostratigraphy for the MECO. Using this new framework, the sedimentary record is interpreted to be continuous across the event, as identified by a pronounced transient benthic foraminiferal δ18O shift of ∼0.8 ‰. Calcareous microfossil biostratigraphic events from widely used zonation schemes are recognized, with generally good agreement between the two holes, highlighting the robustness of the new composite section and allowing us to identify planktic foraminiferal Zones E10–E15 and calcareous nannofossil Zones NP15–18. However, discrepancies in the relative position and ordering of several primary and secondary bioevents with respect to published schemes are noted. Specifically, the stratigraphic highest occurrences of planktic foraminifera, Acarinina bullbrooki, Guembelitrioides nuttalli, and Morozovella aragonensis, and calcareous nannofossils, Chiasmolithus solitus and Sphenolithus furcatolithoides, and the lowest occurrence of Reticulofenestra reticulata all appear higher in the section than would be predicted relative to other bioevents. We also note conspicuous reworking of older microfossils (from planktic foraminiferal Zones E5–E9 and E13) into younger sediments (planktic foraminiferal Zones E14–15) within our study interval consistent with reworking above the MECO interval. Regardless of reworking, the high-quality XRF records enable decimetre-scale correlation between holes and highlight the potential of Site 865 for constraining tropical environmental and biotic changes, not just across the MECO but also throughout the Palaeocene and early-to-middle Eocene interval.",False,0,,True,0

We demonstrate that as the chemical potential difference is increased, the system transitions from Josephson plasma oscillations to either a dissipative (in the limit of low and narrow barriers) or a self-trapped regime (for large and wider barriers), with a crossover between the dissipative and the self-trapping regimes which we explore and characterize for the first time.

Smectite nanoclays such as LAPONITE™ possess unique thixotropic and protein retention properties offering promise for use in growth factor delivery in bone repair and regeneration. This study has examined bone formation mediated by a clinically approved growth factor delivery system (InductOs®) in combination with Laponite gel in an aged female ovine femoral condyle defect preclinical model (10 weeks). Two different designs, one containing a low volume of Laponite gel (LLG) in combination with the InductOs® absorbable collagen sponge (ACS), the other in which Laponite gel formed the implant (HLG), were compared against InductOs® alone and an autograft positive control. Thus, five groups: (i) empty defect, (ii) autograft, (iii) BMP2 + ACS, (iv) BMP2 + ACS + LLG and (v) BMP2 + HLG + ACS were examined in 9 mm × 12 mm defects performed bilaterally in the medial femoral condyles of 24 aged (>5 years) sheep. Bone formation within the defect was assessed using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), digital volume correlation (DVC) for biomechanical characterisation as well as histology. The autograft and InductOs® mediated enhanced bone formation (p < 0001) compared to blank controls, while no significant differences were observed between the Laponite/Collagen/BMP delivery vehicles. However, the current study illustrated the excellent biocompatibility of Laponite and its ability to deliver localised active BMP-2, with the opportunity for improved efficacy with further optimisation. Interestingly, DVC-computed strain distributions indicated that the regenerated bone structure is mechanically adapted to bear external loads from the early remodelling stages of the bone reparation cascade. The current studies of selected nanoclay delivery platforms for BMP, assessed in a clinically relevant large animal model auger well for the development of bone fracture therapeutics for an ageing population.",False,0,,True,0

We implemented an educational activity in two Lao villages to share general antibiotic-related messages and also to learn about people's conceptions and health behaviours. Two rounds of census survey data enabled us to assess the activity's outputs, its knowledge outcomes, and its immediate behavioural impacts in a difference-in-difference design. Our panel data covered 1130 adults over two rounds, including 58 activity participants and 208 villagers exposed indirectly via conversations in the village. We found that activity-related communication circulated among more privileged groups, which limited its indirect effects. Among participants, the educational activity influenced the awareness and understanding of ""drug resistance"", whereas the effects on attitudes were minor. The evidence on the behavioural impacts was sparse and mixed, but the range of possible consequences included a disproportionate uptake of antibiotics from formal healthcare providers.

A pore pressure and compaction instability can develop when the net volume change associated with the reaction is negative, i.e., at intermediate depth in subduction zones. The instability criterion is derived in terms of the dependence of the yield criterion on porosity: if that dependence is strong, instabilities are more likely to occur. We also find that the instability is associated with strain localization, over characteristic length scales determined by the hydraulic diffusivity, the elasto‐plastic parameters of the rock, and the reaction rate. Typical lower bounds for the localization length are of the order of 10 to 100 for antigorite dehydration and deformation at 3 GPa. The fluid pressure and deformation instability is expected to induce stress buildup in the surrounding rocks forming the subducted slab, which provides a mechanism for the nucleation and propagation of intermediate‐depth earthquakes.",False,0,,True,0

We study the observable-mass scaling relations and the X-ray luminosity-temperature relation over the complete observed cluster mass range. As expected, we find the slope of these scaling relations and the evolution of their normalization with redshift departs significantly from the self-similar predictions. However, for a sample of hot clusters with core-excised temperatures $k_{\rm{B}}T\geq5\,\rm{keV}$ the normalization and slope of the observable-mass relations and their evolution are significantly closer to self-similar. The exception is the temperature-mass relation, for which the increased importance of non-thermal pressure support and biased X-ray temperatures leads to a greater departure from self-similarity in the hottest systems. As a consequence, these also affect the slope and evolution of the normalization in the luminosity-temperature relation. The median hot gas profiles show good agreement with observational data at $z=0$ and $z=1$, with their evolution again departing significantly from the self-similar prediction. However, selecting a hot sample of clusters yields profiles that evolve significantly closer to the self-similar prediction. In conclusion, our results show that understanding the selection function is vital for robust calibration of cluster properties with mass and redshift.",False,0,,True,1

Given that the aRIS's PREs are bound by discrete constraints due to low-resolution quantization, this design approach relies on large-scale mixed discrete-continuous problems, which are addressed through a new universal penalised optimization reformulations. Initially, we develop iterations based on convex quadratic solvers (CQ) to tackle the problem of maximizing the users' minimum rate (MR). Given that the computational complexity of these CQs is cubic, leading to high costs in large-scale computations, we introduce a pair of surrogate objectives. These objectives are designed in a way that their constrained optimization can be efficiently managed through iterations of closed-form expressions with scalable complexity, rendering them practical for large-scale computations. This pair of surrogate objectives comprises the maximization of the geometric mean of users' rates (GM-rate maximization) and the soft-maximization of users' MR (soft max-min rate optimization). Remarkably, they not only enhance MR but also contribute to the improvement of the sum-rate (SR). Building upon the GM-rate optimization, we further propose addressing the energy efficiency problem, which achieves a high ratio of SR to power consumption and MR to power dissipation through closed-form expressions. Comprehensive simulations are conducted to validate the efficacy of the proposed solutions.",False,0,,True,0

So far, many aggregation operators of LIVIFNs have been presented. Each of these operators works well in its specific context. But they are not always monotone because their operational rules are not always invariant and persistent. Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, a general framework for modelling epistemic uncertainty, was found to provide the capability for operational rules of fuzzy numbers to overcome these limitations. In this paper, a weighted averaging operator of LIVIFNs based on Dempster-Shafer evidence theory for cognitively inspired decision-making is proposed. Firstly, Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is introduced into linguistic interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy environment and a definition of LIVIFNs under this theory is given. Based on this, four novel operational rules of LIVIFNs are developed and proved to be always invariant and persistent. Using the developed operational rules, a new weighted averaging operator of LIVIFNs is constructed and proved to be always monotone. Based on the constructed operator, a method for solving cognitively inspired decision-making problems with LIVIFNs is presented. The application of the presented method is illustrated via a numerical example. The effectiveness and advantage of the method are demonstrated via quantitative comparisons with several existing methods. For the numerical example, the best alternative determined by the presented method is exactly the same as that determined by other comparison methods. For some specific problems, only the presented method can generate intuitive ranking results. The demonstration results suggest that the presented method is effective in solving cognitively inspired decision-making problems with LIVIFNs. Furthermore, the method will not produce counterintuitive ranking results since its operational rules are always invariant and persistent and its aggregation operator is always monotone.",False,0,,True,0

We propose and demonstrate real-time low-latency wavelength-switched clock-synchronized intra-data center interconnection at 51.2 GBd using a fast tunable laser (with ns scale switching time) and ultra-stable-latency hollow core fiber (HCF) for optically-switched data center networks.

While the companion paper of this study focused on understanding the anatomy of low-frequency, midlatitude climate variability in an idealised, eddy-resolving coupled model, this paper looked at understanding the nature of the wind-induced ocean gyre response using an ocean-only configuration of the same model. Our analysis revealed two, time-averaged responses to an east–west dipole, wind-stress curl anomaly in the ocean basin. Firstly, wind-stress anomalies in the western ocean basin led to changes in relative strength of the inertial recirculation zones and jet-axis tilt. This is consistent with an advection-dominated, nonlinear adjustment of the ocean gyres to anomalous forcing. Secondly, wind-stress curl anomalies in the eastern ocean basin was found to induce a largely independent response involving meridional shifts of the western boundary current extension (WBCE). The effects of time-averaged advection in this region are weak and the discovery of westward-propagating Rossby waves along the WBCE revealed the response is more akin to a baroclinic Rossby wave adjustment.",False,0,,True,0

Bac5 and other AMPs have also been shown to have chemotactic properties and can induce inflammatory cytokine expression by innate immune cells. Recently, AMPs have begun to be investigated for their potential use as novel vaccine adjuvants. In the current work, we characterise the functionality of Bac5 in vitro using murine macrophage-like cells, ex vivo using human tonsil tissue and in vivo using a murine model of vaccination. We report the effects of the peptide in isolation and in the context of co-presentation with mycobacterial antigen and whole, inert Bacillus subtilis spore antigens. We find that Bac5 can trigger the release of nitric oxide from murine macrophages and upregulate surface marker expression including CD86, MHC-I and MHC-II, in the absence of additional agonists. When coupled with mycobacterial Ag85 and B. subtilis spores, Bac5 also enhanced IFNγ secretion. We provide evidence that B. subtilis spores, but not the Bac5 peptide, act as strong adjuvants in promoting antigen-specific immunoglobulin production in Ag85B-vaccinated mice.

The required specifications for memories are, however, often considered too demanding for available technologies. One can change this mindset by introducing memory-assisted measurement-device-independent QKD (MDI-QKD), which imposes less stringent conditions on the memory modules. It has been shown that, in the case of {\em fast} single-qubit memories, we can reach rates and distances not attainable by single no-memory QKD links. Single-qubit memories, such as single atoms or ions, have, currently, too slow of an access time to offer an advantage in practice. Here, we relax that assumption, and consider ensemble-based memories, which satisfy the main two requirements of having short access times and large storage-bandwidth products. Our results, however, suggest that the multiple-excitation effects in such memories can be so detrimental that they may wash away the scaling improvement offered by memory-equipped systems. We then propose an alternative setup that can in principle remedy the above problem. As a prelude to our main problem, we also obtain secret key generation rates for MDI-QKD systems that rely on imperfect single-photon sources with nonzero probabilities of emitting two photons.",False,0,,True,1

There is interest in developing therapies that selectively target the immunosuppressive function of Treg cells within tumours without disrupting their systemic anti‐inflammatory function. High levels of expression of chemokine (C‐C motif) receptor 8 (CCR8) discriminate Treg cells within tumours from those found in systemic lymphoid tissues. It has recently been proposed that disruption of CCR8 function using blocking anti‐CCR8 antibodies results in reduced accumulation of Treg cells within tumours and disruption of their immunosuppressive function. Here, using Ccr8 −/− mice, we show that CCR8 function is not required for Treg cell accumulation or immunosuppression in the context of syngeneic MC38 colorectal adenocarcinoma and B16 melanoma tumours. We observed high levels of CCR8 expression on tumour‐infiltrating Treg cells which were abolished in Ccr8 −/− mice. High levels of CCR8 marked cells with high levels of suppressive function. However, whereas systemic ablation of Treg cells resulted in strikingly diminished tumour burden, growth of subcutaneously implanted tumours was unaffected by systemic CCR8 loss. Consistently, we observed minimal impact of systemic CCR8 ablation on the frequency, phenotype and function of tumour‐infiltrating Treg cells and conventional T (Tconv) function. These findings suggest that CCR8 is not required for Treg cell accumulation and immunosuppressive function within tumours and that depletion of CCR8 + Treg cells rather than blockade of CCR8 function is a more promising avenue for selective immunotherapy.",False,0,,True,0

It is critical to track the optimum electrical operating point through the use of power electronic converters controlled by a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm. The MPPT method based on the open-circuit voltage is arguably the most suitable for the linear electrical characteristic of TEGs. This paper presents an innovative way to perform the open-circuit voltage measure during the pseudonormal operation of the interfacing power electronic converter. The proposed MPPT technique is supported by theoretical analysis and used to control a synchronous Buck-Boost converter. The prototype MPPT converter is controlled by an inexpensive microcontroller, and a lead-acid battery is used to accumulate the harvested energy. Experimental results using commercial TEG devices prove that the converter accurately tracks the maximum power point during thermal transients. Precise measurements in the steady state show that the converter finds the maximum power point with a tracking efficiency of 99.85%.",False,0,,True,1

Particularly, constraint-based stoichiometric models have been widely studied: (i) flux balance analysis (FBA) ( in silico ), and (ii) metabolic flux analysis (MFA) ( in vivo ). Recent studies have enabled the incorporation of thermodynamics and metabolomics data to improve the predictive capabilities of these approaches. However, an in-depth comparison and evaluation of these methods is lacking. This study presents a thorough analysis of two different in silico methods tested against experimental data (metabolomics and 13 C-MFA) for the mesophile Escherichia coli . In particular, a modified version of the recently published matTFA toolbox was created, providing a broader range of physicochemical parameters. Validating against experimental data allowed the determination of the best physicochemical parameters to perform the TFA (Thermodynamics-based Flux Analysis). An analysis of flux pattern changes in the central carbon metabolism between 13 C-MFA and TFA highlighted the limited capabilities of both approaches for elucidating the anaplerotic fluxes. In addition, a method based on centrality measures was suggested to identify important metabolites that (if quantified) would allow to further constrain the TFA. Finally, this study emphasised the need for standardisation in the fluxomics community: novel approaches are frequently released but a thorough comparison with currently accepted methods is not always performed.",False,0,,True,0

However there is much still to be discovered about the fructan polymer pool in this species, especially in regard to its composition and regulation. It is postulated that similar considerable variation for polymer traits may exist, providing useful polymers for biorefining applications. Seasonal effects on fructan content together with fructan synthesis and polymer-size traits have been examined in diverse perennial ryegrass material comprising contrasting plants from a perennial ryegrass F2 mapping family and from populations produced by three rounds of phenotypic selection. Relationships with copy number variation in candidate genes have been investigated. There was little evidence of any variation in fructan metabolism across this diverse germplasm under these conditions that resulted in substantial differences in the complement of fructan polymers present in leaf tissue at high water-soluble carbohydrate concentrations. The importance of fructan synthesis during fructan accumulation was unclear as fructan content and polymer characteristics in intact plants during the growing season did not reflect the capacity for de novo synthesis. However, the retention of fructan in environmental conditions favoring high sink/low source demand may be an important component of the high sugar trait and the roles of breakdown and turnover are discussed.",False,0,,True,0

One such protein is Mms6. This small, amphiphilic protein can self‐assemble and bind ferric ions to aid in magnetite formation. To understand the role of Mms6 during in vitro iron oxide precipitation we have performed in situ pH titrations. We find Mms6 has little effect during ferric salt precipitation, but exerts greatest influence during the incorporation of ferrous ions and conversion of this salt to mixed‐valence iron minerals, suggesting Mms6 has a hitherto unrecorded ferrous iron interacting property which promotes the formation of magnetite in ferrous‐rich solutions. We show ferrous binding to the DEEVE motif within the C‐terminal region of Mms6 by NMR spectroscopy, and model these binding events using molecular simulations. We conclude that Mms6 functions as a magnetite nucleating protein under conditions where ferrous ions predominate.",False,0,,True,0

We compare the simulated ARTEMIS galaxies to observed galaxies in the DustPedia database with similar stellar mass and star formation rate, and to synthetic observations of the simulated galaxies of the Auriga project produced in previous work using a similar post-processing technique. In all cases, global galaxy properties are derived using SED fitting. We find that, similar to Auriga, the post-processed ARTEMIS galaxies generally reproduce the observed scaling relations for global fluxes and physical properties, although dust extinction at FUV/UV wavelengths is underestimated and representative dust temperatures are lower than observed. At a resolved scale, we compare multi-wavelength non-parametric morphological properties of selected disc galaxies across the data sets. We find that the ARTEMIS galaxies largely reproduce the observed morphological trends as a function of wavelength, although they appear to be more clumpy and less symmetrical than observed. We note that the ARTEMIS and Auriga galaxies occupy adjacent regions in the specific star formation versus stellar mass plane, so that the synthetic observation data sets supplement each other.",False,0,,True,0

Despite this, the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency's (DVLA) database of car model registrations remains underexplored as an indicator of socio-economic characteristics. In the past, car ownership itself has been frequently considered as a census proxy variable for affluence. However, this is an increasingly dated interpretation as ownership has become more widespread across society and the value of cars varies considerably. Understanding the geography of different car types, however, is likely to be more informative of local population characteristics as the choice of model is dependent on several factors, notably including the cost and the purpose of the vehicle. In partnership with the Department for Transport (DfT), a car segmentation was produced that grouped every car model registered in England and Wales in 2011 into 10 distinctive categories based on the vehicle's key characteristics. Data representing the total number of registered cars for each car segment and three age groups were made available at a small area geography (known as lower layer super output areas – LSOAs) to be analysed for this study. It revealed that each car segment is uniquely distributed across London, and the rest of England and Wales. The patterns were then compared with key 2011 Census variables on socio-economics to understand the extent to which spatial patterns of broad car characteristics correspond with variances in indicators of social make-up.",False,0,,True,0

In order to shed new light on the deformation mechanisms during cold dwell and to understand better the role of the microstructure, two different bimodal microstructures (fine and coarse transformation product) of TIMETAL®834 were investigated at stress levels below the 0.2% proof stress using a combination of grain orientation mapping and in-situ electron microscopy imaging. This enabled in-depth analysis of 2D slip patterns and slip system activity using High-Resolution Digital Image Correlation (HRDIC), showing that in both microstructures basal slip is initially the dominant slip mode before prismatic slip activity increases approaching the 0.2% proof stress. Comparing the two constituents in the bimodal microstructure, first slip bands are localised predominantly in primary α grains, indicating higher strength of secondary α colonies, particularly for finer transformation products. During 10 min load holds at stresses below 0.2% proof stress, more plastic strain and longer connected slip traces across several grains were observed in the sample with coarse transformation product, indicating higher susceptibility to cold creep deformation. Full-field crystal deformation modelling was used to determine local stresses in individual grains at the onset of plasticity and test the hypothesis that the dominance of basal slip at low-stress levels can be explained by the elastic anisotropy in Ti alloys. While consideration of elastic anisotropy increased resolved shear stress (RSS) values for basal slip relative to prismatic slip, it did not unambiguously explain the early activation of basal slip. Furthermore, thermal residual stresses at the crystal level, due to the anisotropy of coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE), were included in the simulation, which created a wider spread of the RSS data but did not preferentially promote high RSS values for grains well aligned for basal slip. In the absence of an unambiguous conclusion, it is hypothesised that basal slip might display lower critical resolved shear stress values than typically reported but high work hardening rates compared to prismatic slip.",False,0,,True,0

In this study, a low‐cost Ni−S‐based catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction was prepared via a simple electrodeposition process from a modified Watts bath recipe. Physical characterisation methods suggest this deposit film to be amorphous. Optimisation of the electrodeposition parameters of the Ni x S y catalyst was carried out using a rotating disk electrode setup. The optimised catalyst exhibited excellent catalytical performance in 1 M KOH on a microelectrode, with overpotentials of 41 mV, 111 mV and 202 mV at 10, 100 and 1000 mA cm −2 with Tafel slope of 67.9 mV dec −1 recorded at 333 K. Long‐term testing of the catalyst demonstrated steady performance over a 24 h period on microelectrode at 100 mA cm −2 with only 71 mV and 37 mV overpotential increase at 293 K and 333 K respectively. Full cell testing with the optimised Ni x S y as cathode and NiFe(OH) 2 as anode showed 1.88 V after 1 h electrolysis at 500 mA cm −2 in 1 M KOH under 333 K with FAA‐3‐30 membrane.",False,0,,True,0

Here, we add a demographics scheme (tree recruitment, growth, and mortality) to a recently developed non-demographic model - the Trait-based Forest Simulator (TFS) – to explore the roles of climate and plant traits in controlling forest productivity and structure. We compared two sites with differing climates (seasonal versus aseasonal precipitation) and plant traits. Through an initial validation simulation, we assessed whether the model converges on observed forest properties (productivity, demographic and structural variables) using datasets of functional traits, structure, and climate to model the carbon cycle at the two sites. In a second set of simulations, we tested the relative importance of climate and plant traits for forest properties within the TFS framework using the climate from the two sites with hypothetical trait distributions representing two axes of functional variation ('fast' versus 'slow' leaf traits, and high versus low wood density). The adapted model with demographics reproduced observed variation in gross (GPP) and net (NPP) primary production, and respiration. However NPP and respiration at the level of plant organs (leaf, stem, and root) were poorly simulated. Mortality and recruitment rates were underestimated. The equilibrium forest structure differed from observations of stem numbers suggesting either that the forests are not currently at equilibrium or that mechanisms are missing from the model. Findings from the second set of simulations demonstrated that differences in productivity were driven by climate, rather than plant traits. Contrary to expectation, varying leaf traits had no influence on GPP. Drivers of simulated forest structure were complex, with a key role for wood density mediated by its link to tree mortality. Modelled mortality and recruitment rates were linked to plant traits alone, drought-related mortality was not accounted for. In future, model development should focus on improving allocation, mortality, organ respiration, simulation of understory trees and adding hydraulic traits. This type of model that incorporates diverse tree strategies, detailed forest structure and realistic physiology is necessary if we are to be able to simulate tropical forest responses to global change scenarios.",False,0,,True,0

In this research, natural struvite was solubilized by Aspergillus niger and the biomass-free struvite leachate was investigated for its ability to recover cerium. It was shown that struvite was completed solubilized following 2 weeks of fungal growth, which released inorganic phosphate (P i ) from the mineral by the production of oxalic acid. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that crystals with distinctive morphologies were formed in the natural struvite leachate after mixing with Ce 3+ . Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed the formation of cerium phosphate hydrate [Ce(PO 4 )·H 2 O] at lower Ce concentrations and a mixture of phosphate and cerium oxalate decahydrate [Ce 2 (C 2 O 4 ) 3 ·10H 2 O] at higher Ce concentrations. The formation of these biogenic Ce minerals leads to the removal of &gt; 99% Ce from solution. Thermal decomposition experiments showed that the biogenic Ce phosphates could be transformed into a mixture of CePO 4 and CeO 2 (cerianite) after heat treatment at 1000 °C. These results provide a new perspective of the fungal biotransformation of soluble REE species using struvite leachate, and also indicate the potential of using the recovered REE as biomaterial precursors with possible applications in the biosynthesis of novel nanomaterials, elemental recycling and biorecovery.

However, atomic experimental realizations have been limited so far by the number of artificial lattice sites that can be feasibly coupled along the synthetic dimension. Here, we experimentally realize for the first time a very long and controllable synthetic dimension of atomic harmonic trap states. To create this, we couple trap states by dynamically modulating the trapping potential of the atomic cloud with patterned light. By controlling the detuning between the frequency of the driving potential and the trapping frequency, we implement a controllable force in the synthetic dimension. This induces Bloch oscillations in which atoms move periodically up and down tens of atomic trap states. We experimentally observe the key characteristics of this behavior in the real-space dynamics of the cloud, and verify our observations with numerical simulations and semiclassical theory. The Bloch oscillations thus act as a smoking-gun signature of the synthetic dimension, and allow us to characterize the effective band structure. Our methods provide an efficient approach for the manipulation and control of highly excited trap states, and set the stage for the future exploration of topological physics in higher dimensions through the use of a tunable artificial gauge field and finite-range interactions.",False,0,,True,0

SINV infection also stimulates autophagy, which has an important role in controlling the innate immune response. The importance of autophagy to virus-induced translation arrest is not well understood. In this study, we show that the autophagy protein ATG16L1 not only regulates eIF2α phosphorylation and the translation of viral and antiviral proteins, but also controls SG assembly. Early in infection (2hpi), capsids were recruited by host factors Cytotoxic Granule-Associated RNA Binding Protein (TIA1), Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1), and vasolin-containing protein 1 (VCP), to a single perinuclear body, which co-localized with the viral pattern recognition sensors, double stranded RNA-activated protein-kinase R (PKR) and RIG-I. By 6hpi, there was increased eIF2α phosphorylation and viral protein synthesis. However, in cells lacking the autophagy protein ATG16L1, SG assembly was inhibited and capsid remained in numerous small foci in the cytoplasm containing YBX1, TIA1 with RIG-I, and these persisted for over 8hpi. In the absence of ATG16L1, there was little phosphorylation of eIF2α and low levels of viral protein synthesis. Compared to wild type cells, there was potentiated interferon protein and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) mRNA expression.

Cyber resilience in a domestic or non-work setting is important because we know that the majority of people will face cyber threats in their use of technology across a range of contexts, and the ability to resist a cyber attack, or quickly recover and learn from a successful attack, is as important for individuals’ wellbeing as it is for organizations. There is, unfortunately, a dearth of studies on the cyber resilience of people, in part because it is not clear how such a construct could be defined and then measured. In the present work, we present a series of five studies—with a total sample of n = 1503—that sought to develop and validate a theoretically based measure of cyber resilience for individuals. The final scale, comprising 16 items and 4 subscales (self-efficacy, learning and growth, social support, and helplessness), demonstrates good internal reliability and validity.",False,0,,True,0

Using data from ground‐based auroral imagers, we study repeatable signatures of along‐arc auroral beads, which are thought to represent the ionospheric projection of magnetospheric instability in the near‐Earth plasma sheet. We show that the growth and spatial scales of these wave‐like fluctuations are similar across multiple events, indicating that each sudden auroral brightening has a common explanation. We find statistically that growth rates for auroral beads peak at low wave number with the most unstable spatial scales mapping to an azimuthal wavelength λ ≈ 1700–2500 km in the equatorial magnetosphere at around 9–12 R E . We compare growth rates and spatial scales with a range of theoretical predictions of magnetotail instabilities, including the Cross‐Field Current Instability and the Shear Flow Ballooning Instability. We conclude that, although the Cross‐Field Current instability can generate similar magnitude of growth rates, the range of unstable wave numbers indicates that the Shear Flow Ballooning Instability is the most likely explanation for our observations.",False,0,,True,0

For smooth or roughened hydrophilic surfaces, such as glass or acrylic, there is essentially no difference between these elastic liquids and a Newtonian comparator fluid (with identical shear viscosity, surface tension, and static contact angle). In contrast for embossed polytetrafluoroethylene superhydrophobic surfaces, profound differences are observed: the elastic drops slide at a significantly reduced rate and complex branch-like patterns are left on the surface by the drop's wake including, on various scales, beads-on-a-string like phenomena. Microscopy images indicate that the strong viscoelastic effect is caused by stretching filaments of fluid from isolated islands, residing at pinning sites on the surface pillars, of the order ∼30 μm in size.

However, the toxicity and instability of best-in-class lead–halide perovskite materials make them nonideal. To combat these issues, we replaced lead with bismuth and explored the sensitivity of these new lead-free materials to the valency and bonding of their cationic organic groups. Specifically, we synthesized and characterized the materials properties and photophysical properties of hexane-1,6-diammonium bismuth pentaiodide ((HDA2+)BiI5) and compared them to an analogue containing a more volatile organic group with half the number of carbon and nitrogen atoms in the form of n-propylammonium ((PA+)xBiI3+x, where 1 < x < 3). The full crystallographic structures of (HDA2+)BiI5 and (PA+)xBiI3+x were resolved by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. (HDA2+)BiI5 was shown to be pure-phase and have a one-dimensional structure, whereas (PA+)xBiI3+x was shown to be a mix of one-dimensional and zero-dimensional phases. Structures of the materials were confirmed by synchrotron X-ray diffraction of powders. Both (HDA2+)BiI5 and (PA+)xBiI3+x exhibit steady-state photoluminescence at room temperature. Density functional theory calculations of (HDA2+)BiI5 predict electronic absorption features and a ∼2 eV bandgap that are consistent with those observed experimentally. Structure–property relationships of the materials were examined, and moisture tolerance and film quality were found to be superior for dication-containing (HDA2+)BiI5 in relation to monocation-containing (PA+)xBiI3+x. We hypothesize that these trends are in part due to a molecular bridging effect enabled by the presence of the dicationic hexanediammonium groups in (HDA2+)BiI5. Solar cells fabricated using (HDA2+)BiI5 as the photoactive layer exhibited photovoltaic action while those containing (PA+)xBiI3+x did not, suggesting that organic dicationic groups are beneficial to light-absorber morphology and ultimately solar-cell performance.",False,0,,True,0

Recent years have seen an increasing focus on methods that are specific to damage identification, with the maximisation of correct classification outcomes being prioritised. The objectives of this article are to present the SPO for SHM problem, to provide an overview of the current state of the art in this area, and to identify promising emergent trends within the literature. The key conclusions drawn are that there remains a great deal of scope for research in a number of key areas, including the development of methods that promote robustness to modelling uncertainty, benign effects within measured data, and failures within the sensor network. There also remains a paucity of studies that demonstrate practical, experimental evaluation of developed SHM system designs. Finally, it is argued that the pursuit of novel or highly efficient optimisation methods may be considered to be of secondary importance in an SPO context, given that the optimisation effort is expended at the design stage.",False,0,,True,0

As transparency‐making has recently transmuted from a progressive instrument to counter corruption into a new universal ideological formation, it is time to problematize the concept of transparency and its uses. In this article, I consider transparency not as a moral principle or static ideology but as a terrain of political struggle over its meaning and practices. An emerging literature in anthropology highlights how transparency has become a form of governance that leads to a sense of deprofessionalization in working life. Based on ethnographic research with activist networks and small‐scale farmers in Italy, I investigate experiments with horizontal and inclusive forms of alternative transparency‐making in food processing. I consider three interrelated emblematic frictions within these experiments: informal versus formal, top‐down versus horizontal, and not‐for‐profit versus commercial. While these experimental forms of transparency‐making allow small‐scale farmers to reappropriate a sense of autonomy and professionalism, the frictions indicate that conventional and alternative transparency‐making are not diametrically opposed. Frictions in emancipatory transparency‐making repoliticize decision‐making processes in ways that are unknown in contemporary concepts of transparency. Ultimately, the concept of emancipatory transparency‐making calls for engagement in open dialogical processes.",False,0,,True,0

The formulation of methods appears to be specific to the goal that is sought as well as the cultural influence of the region in which the analysis was developed and deployed.

Although these X-ray sources are predicted to have important implications for high-redshift observable signals, such as the hydrogen 21-cm signal from cosmic dawn and the cosmic X-ray background, their properties are poorly explored, leaving theoretical models largely uninformed. In this paper we model a population of X-ray binaries arising from zero metallicity stars. We explore how their properties depend on the adopted initial mass function (IMF) of primordial stars, finding a strong effect on their number and X-ray production efficiency. We also present scaling relations between XRBs and their X-ray emission with the local star formation rate, which can be used in sub-grid models in numerical simulations to improve the X-ray feedback prescriptions. Specifically, we find that the uniformity and strength of the X-ray feedback in the intergalactic medium is strongly dependant on the IMF. Bottom-heavy IMFs result in a smoother distribution of XRBs, but have a luminosity orders of magnitude lower than more top-heavy IMFs. Top-heavy IMFs lead to more spatially uneven, albeit strong, X-ray emission. An intermediate IMF has a strong X-ray feedback while sustaining an even emission across the intergalactic medium. These differences in X-ray feedback could be probed in the future with measurements of the cosmic dawn 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen, which offers us a new way of constraining population III IMF.",False,0,,True,0

The ro-vibrational energy levels and wavefunctions are computed using the variational program trove. The line list ranges up to 10 000 cm$^{-1}$ ($\lambda \ge 1$ μm) and contains 929 795 249 transitions between 1 269 961 states with $J\le 30$. The line list should be applicable for temperatures up to $\sim$1000 K. To improve the accuracy of the line positions, a set of experimentally derived energy levels of $^{15}$NH$_3$ is produced using the marvel (Measured Active Rotation Vibration Energy Level) procedure. To this end, 37 experimental sources of the line positions of $^{15}$NH$_3$ available in the literature are collected, combined, and systematized to produce a self-consistent spectroscopic network of 21 095 $^{15}$NH$_3$ transitions covering 40 vibrational bands ranging up to 6818 cm$^{-1}$ and resulting in 2777 energy term values. These marvel energies are then used to replace the theoretical values in the CoYuTe-15 line list and also complemented by pseudo-marvel energies obtained by an isotopologue extrapolation using the previously reported marvel energies of the $^{14}$NH$_3$ parent isotopologue of ammonia. A list of 53 856 high-resolution transitions between marvel states and theoretical intensities is provided in the HITRAN format. Comparison with the recent experimental spectra of $^{15}$NH$_3$ illustrate the potential of the line list for detections and as an efficient assistant in spectroscopic assignments.

It is particularly challenging to understand diversity–diversity links across domains and habitats, because data are rarely available for multiple above- and below-ground taxa across multiple sites. Here, we analyse data from a unique biodiversity data set gathered across a variety of oceanic temperate terrestrial habitats in Wales, comprising 300 sites with co-located soil microbial, plant, bird and pollinator surveys along with climate and soil physicochemical information. Soil groups are analysed using metabarcoding of the 16S, ITS1 and 18S DNA regions, allowing in-depth characterisation of microbial and soil animal biodiversity. We explore biodiversity relationships along three aspects of community composition: First, we assess correlation between the alpha diversity of different groups. Second, we assess whether biotic turnover between sites is correlated across different groups. Finally, we investigate the co-occurrence of individual taxa across sites. In each analysis, we assess the contribution of linear or nonlinear environmental effects. We find that a positive correlation between alpha diversity of plants, soil bacteria, soil fungi, soil heterotrophic protists, bees and butterflies is in fact driven by complex nonlinear responses to abiotic drivers. In contrast, environmental variation did not account for positive associations between the diversity of plants and both birds and AM fungi, suggesting a role for biotic interactions. Both the diversity and taxon-level associations between the differing soil groups remained even after accounting for nonlinear environmental gradients. Above-ground, spatial factors played larger roles in driving biotic communities, while linear environmental gradients were sufficient to explain many group- and taxon-level relationships. Synthesis. Our results show how nonlinear responses to environmental gradients drive many of the relationships between plant biodiversity and the biodiversity of above- and below-ground biological communities. Our work shows how different aspects of biodiversity might respond nonlinearly to changing environments and identifies cases where management-induced changes in one community could either influence other taxa or lead to loss of apparent biological associations.",False,0,,True,0

Linked to global trade, human movement and climate change, a number of outbreaks have attracted high public and media attention. However, there is surprisingly little evidence characterising the nature of public attentiveness to these events, nor how publics might respond to evolving outbreaks and the management actions taken. This paper presents findings from an online questionnaire involving 1334 respondents nationally-representative of the British public to assess awareness, concern and willingness to adopt biosecure behaviours. Despite revealing low levels of awareness and knowledge, the results indicate that the British public is concerned about the health of trees, forests and woodlands and is moderately willing to adopt biosecure behaviours. A key finding is that membership of environmental organisations and strong place identity are likely to engender higher awareness and levels of concern about tree pests and diseases. Further, those who visit woodlands regularly are likely to be more aware than non-visitors, and gardeners are more likely to be concerned than non-gardeners. Women, older respondents, those with strong place identity and dependence, members of environmental organisations, woodland visitors and gardeners were most likely to express a willingness to adopt biosecure behaviours.

This paper presents an overarching framework that supports the development of strategies for reliable provision of services while explicitly addressing the need for greater resilience to emerging threats, leading to more sustainable solutions. The framework logically relates global threats, the water system (in its broadest sense), impacts on system performance, and social, economic, and environmental consequences. It identifies multiple opportunities for intervention, illustrating how mitigation, adaptation, coping, and learning each address different elements of the framework. This provides greater clarity to decision makers and will enable better informed choices to be made. The framework facilitates four types of analysis and evaluation to support the development of reliable, resilient, and sustainable solutions: “top‐down,” “bottom‐up,” “middle based,” and “circular” and provides a clear, visual representation of how/when each may be used. In particular, the potential benefits of a middle‐based analysis, which focuses on system failure modes and their impacts and enables the effects of unknown threats to be accounted for, are highlighted.

We perform the first multi-model intercomparison of the impact of nudged meteorology on the stratospheric residual circulation using hindcast simulations from the Chemistry–Climate Model Initiative (CCMI). We examine simulations over the period 1980–2009 from seven models in which the meteorological fields are nudged towards a reanalysis dataset and compare these with their equivalent free-running simulations and the reanalyses themselves. We show that for the current implementations, nudging meteorology does not constrain the mean strength of the stratospheric residual circulation and that the inter-model spread is similar, or even larger, than in the free-running simulations. The nudged models generally show slightly stronger upwelling in the tropical lower stratosphere compared to the free-running versions and exhibit marked differences compared to the directly estimated residual circulation from the reanalysis dataset they are nudged towards. Downward control calculations applied to the nudged simulations reveal substantial differences between the climatological lower-stratospheric tropical upward mass flux (TUMF) computed from the modelled wave forcing and that calculated directly from the residual circulation. This explicitly shows that nudging decouples the wave forcing and the residual circulation so that the divergence of the angular momentum flux due to the mean motion is not balanced by eddy motions, as would typically be expected in the time mean. Overall, nudging meteorological fields leads to increased inter-model spread for most of the measures of the mean climatological stratospheric residual circulation assessed in this study. In contrast, the nudged simulations show a high degree of consistency in the inter-annual variability in the TUMF in the lower stratosphere, which is primarily related to the contribution to variability from the resolved wave forcing. The more consistent inter-annual variability in TUMF in the nudged models also compares more closely with the variability found in the reanalyses, particularly in boreal winter. We apply a multiple linear regression (MLR) model to separate the drivers of inter-annual and long-term variations in the simulated TUMF; this explains up to ∼75 % of the variance in TUMF in the nudged simulations. The MLR model reveals a statistically significant positive trend in TUMF for most models over the period 1980–2009. The TUMF trend magnitude is generally larger in the nudged models compared to their free-running counterparts, but the intermodel range of trends doubles from around a factor of 2 to a factor of 4 due to nudging. Furthermore, the nudged models generally do not match the TUMF trends in the reanalysis they are nudged towards for trends over different periods in the interval 1980–2009. Hence, we conclude that nudging does not strongly constrain long-term trends simulated by the chemistry–climate model (CCM) in the residual circulation. Our findings show that while nudged simulations may, by construction, produce accurate temperatures and realistic representations of fast horizontal transport, this is not typically the case for the slower zonal mean vertical transport in the stratosphere. Consequently, caution is required when using nudged simulations to interpret the behaviour of stratospheric tracers that are affected by the residual circulation.",False,0,,True,0

However, colloidal stability and interfacial charge transfer efficiency are difficult to optimize simultaneously since the ligand layer often acts as both a shell stabilizing the nanocrystals in colloidal suspension and a barrier reducing the efficiency of interfacial charge transfer. Here, we show that, for cysteine-coated, Pt-decorated CdS nanocrystals and Na2SO3 as hole scavenger, triethanolamine (TEOA) replaces the original cysteine ligands in situ and prolongs the highly efficient and steady H2 evolution period by more than a factor of 10. It is shown that Na2SO3 is consumed during H2 generation while TEOA makes no significant contribution to the H2 generation. An apparent quantum yield of 31.5%, a turnover frequency of 0.11 H2/Pt/s, and an interfacial charge transfer rate faster than 0.3 ps were achieved in the TEOA stabilized system. The short length, branched structure and weak binding of TEOA to CdS as well as sufficient free TEOA in the solution are the keys to enhancing colloidal stability and maintaining efficient interfacial charge transfer at the same time. Additionally, TEOA is commercially available and cheap, and we anticipate that this approach can be widely applied in many photocatalytic applications involving colloidal nanocrystals.",False,0,,True,0

Our three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations show that in this regime the electron beam can evolve into layered short microelectron bunches when collisions are relatively weak. The phenomenon is attributed to a secondary instability, on the space- and timescales of the electron skin depth (tens of nanometers) and few femtoseconds of strong electrostatic modulation of the microelectron current filaments formed by Weibel-like instability of the original electron beam.

This uncertainty arises in part from the difficulty in measuring the vertical distributions of aerosols, and only sporadic vertically resolved observations are available. We often have to settle for less informative vertically aggregated proxies such as aerosol optical depth (AOD). In this work, we develop a framework for the vertical disaggregation of AOD into extinction profiles, that is, the measure of light extinction throughout an atmospheric column, using readily available vertically resolved meteorological predictors such as temperature, pressure, or relative humidity. Using Bayesian nonparametric modeling, we devise a simple Gaussian process prior over aerosol vertical profiles and update it with AOD observations to infer a distribution over vertical extinction profiles. To validate our approach, we use ECHAM-HAM aerosol-climate model data which offers self-consistent simulations of meteorological covariates, AOD, and extinction profiles. Our results show that, while very simple, our model is able to reconstruct realistic extinction profiles with well-calibrated uncertainty, outperforming by an order of magnitude the idealized baseline which is typically used in satellite AOD retrieval algorithms. In particular, the model demonstrates a faithful reconstruction of extinction patterns arising from aerosol water uptake in the boundary layer. Observations however suggest that other extinction patterns, due to aerosol mass concentration, particle size, and radiative properties, might be more challenging to capture and require additional vertically resolved predictors.",False,0,,True,0

These changes have a direct effect on the mechanical and corrosion properties of the alloy, so understanding them is critical to improving performance. This paper describes a classical model that predicts SPP evolution over the whole range of observed behaviour, from complete amorphization at low temperature through formation of an amorphous rim, iron loss, and dissolution at intermediate temperatures, and a return to stability at high temperatures. A single set of assumptions is used, with the different regimes of behaviour arising from a natural competition between mechanisms. The model suggests that there is significant overlap in regimes, and for the same temperatures formation of an amorphous rim and SPP dissolution can occur simultaneously. The most interesting behaviour is seen at intermediate temperatures (520–620 K), where there is a transition from irradiation to thermally dominated processes. The model qualitatively captures experimental observations, but for more accurate quantitative predictions a number of unknown parameters require further study. These include the effect of irradiation on the solubility and diffusion rates of alloying elements.",False,0,,True,0

In addition to regulating genomic transcriptional activity via RA receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs), non-genomic mechanisms of RA have been described, including the regulation of ERK1/2 kinase phosphorylation, but are poorly characterised. In this study, we test the hypothesis that genomic and non-genomic mechanisms of RA are regulated independently with respect to the involvement of ligand-dependent RA receptors. A panel of 28 retinoids (compounds with vitamin A-like activity) showed a marked disparity in genomic (gene expression) versus non-genomic (ERK1/2 phosphorylation) assays. These results demonstrate that the capacity of a compound to activate gene transcription does not necessarily correlate with its ability to regulate a non-genomic activity such as ERK 1/2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, a neurite outgrowth assay indicated that retinoids that could only induce either genomic, or non-genomic activities, were not strong promoters of neurite outgrowth, and that activities with respect to both transcriptional regulation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation produced maximum neurite outgrowth. These results suggest that the development of effective retinoids for clinical use will depend on the selection of compounds which have maximal activity in non-genomic as well as genomic assays.",False,0,,True,0

We consider a practical phase model where both phase shift and reflection amplitude are discrete variables to vary the reflection coefficients of the IRS. Furthermore, we introduce the buffer-aided relay to enhance the secrecy performance, but the use of the buffer leads to the cost of delay. Thus, we aim to maximize either the average secrecy rate with a delay constraint or the throughput with both delay and secrecy constraints, by jointly optimizing the buffer-aided relay selection and the IRS reflection coefficients. To obtain the solution of these two optimization problems, we divide each of the problems into two sub-tasks and then develop a distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning scheme for the two cooperative sub-tasks, each relay node represents an agent in the distributed learning. We apply the distributed reinforcement learning scheme to optimize the IRS reflection coefficients, and then utilize an agent on the source to learn the optimal relay selection based on the optimal IRS reflection coefficients in each iteration. Simulation results show that the proposed learning-based scheme uses an iterative approach to learn from the environment for approximating an optimal solution via the exploration of multiple agents, which outperforms the benchmark schemes.",False,0,,True,0

We assessed the contribution of socioeconomic trajectories during early adulthood (16–24 years) to cardiovascular health in mid-adulthood (46 years). Methods Participants from the 1970 British Cohort Study with socioeconomic data available in early adulthood were included (n=12 423). Longitudinal latent class analysis identified socioeconomic trajectories, based on patterns of economic activity throughout early adulthood. Cardiometabolic risk factors (46 years) were regressed on socioeconomic trajectory class (16–24 years), testing mediation by adult socioeconomic position (46 years). Models were stratified by sex and adjusted for childhood socioeconomic position (SEP) and adolescent health. Results Six early adulthood socioeconomic trajectories were identified: (1) Continued Education (20.2%), (2) Managerial Employment (16.0%), (3) Skilled Non-manual Employment (20.9%), (4) Skilled Manual Employment (18.9%), (5) Partly Skilled Employment (15.8%) and (6) Economically Inactive (8.1%). The ‘Continued Education’ trajectory class showed the best cardiovascular health at age 46 years, with the lowest levels of cardiometabolic risk factors. For example, systolic blood pressure was 128.9 mm Hg (95% CI 127.8 to 130.0) among men in the ‘Continued Education’ class, compared with 131.3 mm Hg (95% CI 130.4 to 132.2) among men in the ‘Skilled Manual’ class. Patterns across classes 2–6 differed by risk factor and sex. The observed associations were largely not mediated by SEP at age 46 years. Conclusion Findings suggest an independent contribution of early adulthood socioeconomic trajectories to development of later life cardiovascular inequalities. Further work is needed to understand mediators of this relationship and potential for interventions to mitigate these pathways.",False,0,,True,0

Based on the FORGE and BRIDGE $N$-body simulation suites presented in companion papers, we construct 500,000 deg$^2$ of mock Stage-IV lensing data, sampling a pair of 4-dimensional volumes designed for the training of emulators. We validate the accuracy of MGLenS with inference analyses based on the lensing power spectrum exploiting our implementation of $f(R)$ and nDGP theoretical predictions within the cosmoSIS cosmological inference package. A Fisher analysis reveals that the vast majority of the constraining power from such a survey comes from the highest redshift galaxies alone. We further find from a full likelihood sampling that cosmic shear can achieve 95% CL constraints on the modified gravity parameters of log$_{10}\left[ f_{R_0}\right] &lt; -5.24$ and log$_{10}\left[ H_0 r_c\right] &gt; -0.05$, after marginalising over intrinsic alignments of galaxies and including scales up to $\ell=5000$.

Scale cuts at $\ell=3000$ reduce the degeneracy breaking between $S_8$ and the modified gravity parameters, while photometric redshift uncertainty seem to play a subdominant role in our error budget.

Stars of this type have very limited emission in the photosynthetically active region of the spectrum (400–700 nm), suggesting that they may not be able to support oxygenic photosynthesis. However, photoautotrophs on Earth frequently exploit very dim environments with the aid of highly structured and extremely efficient antenna systems. Moreover, the anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria, which do not need to oxidize water to source electrons, can exploit far-red and near-infrared light. Here, we apply a simple model of a photosynthetic antenna to a range of model stellar spectra, ranging from ultracool (2300 K) to Sun-like (5800 K). We assume that a photosynthetic organism will evolve an antenna that maximizes the rate of energy input while also minimizing fluctuations. The latter is the noise cancelling principle recently reported by Arp et al. Applied to the solar spectrum, this predicts optimal antenna configurations in agreement with the chlorophyll Soret absorption bands. Applied to cooler stars, the optimal antenna peaks become redder with decreasing stellar temperature, crossing to the typical wavelength ranges associated with anoxygenic photoautotrophs at ∼3300 K. Lastly, we compare the relative input power delivered by antennae of equivalent size around different stars and find that the predicted variation is within the same order of magnitude. We conclude that low-mass stars do not automatically present light-limiting conditions for photosynthesis, but they may select for anoxygenic organisms.",False,0,,True,0

Although some successes have been recorded in developing this technology, its commercialization has been generally slow as evidenced in the cancellation of high profile projects across the world.

Basic economic principles of supply and demand ensure that, as target species become ever rarer, their market value continues to rise, gradually pushing them towards extinction (Courchamp et al. 2006; Nowell 2012a). One particular problem is that anti-poaching rangers often arrive too late at crime scenes to arrest criminals, making poaching a low-risk and high-gains enterprise (Wyler & Sheikh 2013). Here, we identify an opportunity to address this fundamental problem – we propose that cutting-edge tracking technology could be harnessed to implement effective 'real-time poaching-alert systems'. Animals would be fitted with miniature electronic devices ('biologgers') that can detect a poaching event, establish its exact location and relay data remotely to ground teams. Such systems should considerably increase the chances of successful interception, and thereby, escalate the actual and perceived risks of poaching, establishing a powerful new deterrent. In combination with other mitigation strategies (reviewed below), this innovative approach could lead to a much-needed breakthrough in the increasingly desperate fight against wildlife crime. While a wide range of species is targeted for illegal trading, we focus here on the poaching of large mammals, as these are often particularly vulnerable due to their naturally low population densities and reproductive rates. Three case studies serve to illustrate the urgency of implementing effective anti-poaching measures (cf. Nowell 2012b), but our novel approach would no doubt benefit many other species. Rhinos are currently experiencing unprecedented poaching pressure (Fig. 1), with rates of one animal killed every 13 hours in some areas, and are fast heading towards wholesale extinction in the wild (Biggs et al. 2013). In fact, following a precipitous, poaching-induced population crash in the 1960s (Emslie & Brooks 1999), the African western black rhino was declared extinct by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2011 (Biggs et al. 2013). As the price of ivory is rising, elephants fare little better and could be virtually extinct across most of their African range by 2020, unless poaching off-take is considerably reduced (Wasser et al. 2008; see also Maisels et al. 2013). Finally, tigers are another group under extreme pressure (Nowell & Xu 2007; Walston et al. 2010), with three subspecies having already been lost in the last 70 years, and a lack of confirmed sightings from southern China likely signalling another extinction event (Tilson, Traylor-Holzer & Jiang 1997). Many anti-poaching measures have been explored over the years (Sutherland 2008), including the following: environmental education programmes, to reduce demand for wildlife parts in East Asia (Lee & Tilbury 1998; Nowell & Xu 2007); legalization of high-value products, such as ivory or rhino horn, to control trade dynamics (Gillson & Lindsay 2003; Martin et al. 2012; Biggs et al. 2013); targeted monitoring of money-laundering activities, to hamper illegal trading (as highlighted by a recent international summit; Coghlan 2014); drastic in situ management of threatened animal populations, such as large-scale dehorning of rhinos, to reduce poaching opportunities (Lindsey & Taylor 2011); and 'militarization' of nature reserves (Milliken & Shaw 2012; see below), to facilitate arrests and deter criminal activities. As we have illustrated above, however, illegal trade in wildlife products remains rife, and novel solutions are urgently needed. Our proposal aims at increasing the effectiveness of a widely used approach for protecting the most critically endangered species, the deployment of mobile, armed anti-poaching units (Milliken & Shaw 2012). While these teams are often highly trained and well equipped, they generally have no way of knowing the exact time and location of poaching events. Since many target species are wide ranging and live in inaccessible habitats, this means that carcasses are often only found days or weeks after death (Martin 2001). As a result, arrests of poachers are rare and resources are mainly being focussed on securing evidence (Wasser et al. 2008), which is often insufficient for successful prosecution. Our proposed real-time poaching-alert systems would enable rangers to head towards crime scenes with rapid response times, substantially increasing the chances of apprehending suspects. In conjunction with legislation that ensures the severe punishment of convicted poachers, these altered risk dynamics should substantially reduce the economic attractiveness of poaching, giving heavily persecuted animal populations time to recover. In fact, even a temporary slowing of harvest rates would be valuable, as it would allow longer-term measures – such as educational programmes – to deliver benefits. The rationale of our proposed biologging system is straightforward (for a schematic illustration, see Fig. 2, and for a summary of key challenges, see Table 1). Animals are fitted with miniature electronic tags that detect poaching events and transmit relevant information remotely to anti-poaching units on the ground. In terms of technological implementation, the integration of a few existing, well-tested components would enable an effective three-step process for raising an alarm: detection –location – transmission/alert. Exact system specifications will depend on a wide range of factors, including the size, behaviour and habitat preferences of the species in question, as well as the availability of local infrastructure and other resources, but the following description outlines key principles. A range of sensors could be used to detect when an animal is shot or trapped, including accelerometers or heart-rate sensors (Rutz & Hays 2009; see Table 1). To avoid false alarms, sensors would require careful calibration before system deployment and could even be combined within a single tag, to enable redundant event-triggering (i.e. multiple sensors must trigger before the tag raises an alarm) or remote validation – for example, an accelerometer could trigger an integrated video camera (Fig. 2; Rutz et al. 2007; Watanabe & Takahashi 2013) or microphone (Lynch et al. 2013). Once the tag's sensors have confirmed a poaching event, an on-board GPS receiver is booted up (Tomkiewicz et al. 2010), to establish the position of the trapped, injured or dead animal. State-of-the-art systems can estimate coordinates of suitable accuracy (within tens of metres) within split-seconds, with minimal power requirements (e.g. Fastloc). In the final step, the tag communicates the event – that is, animal ID, trigger time, sensor readings and GPS coordinate information – to a mission control centre and/or directly to rangers in the field. This could be achieved through various routes, including satellite uplinks (e.g. Iridium), UHF transmission, or pre-existing or ad hoc mobile phone networks. We estimate that a well-designed system could raise an alarm within ca. 10 s, which in the majority of scenarios will be faster than poachers could reach the animal and destroy its tag. Anti-poaching units often have helicopters at their disposal, ensuring that crime scenes could be reached within minutes, or tens of minutes, after receiving an alert (Fig. 2), even in vast and inaccessible patrol areas. Where helicopters are not available, reserves would at least be warned of ongoing poaching activity, enabling them to focus ranger resources spatially, patrol park perimeters and conduct targeted vehicle checks, greatly increasing the chances of apprehending poachers. The proposed technology should not be confused with standard satellite tracking, as routinely used with endangered species (e.g. Galanti et al. 2006). Although conventional GPS loggers could in principle be employed to infer poaching events from animals' movement trajectories, costly time delays – to establish whether a stationary animal is merely resting or has indeed been injured or killed – would rule out their utility for guiding ad hoc intervention. Furthermore, constant sampling and relaying of positional data would quickly deplete batteries (in cases where solar power is not an option), which is not an issue with the 'one-shot' tags we envisage here. Likewise, the marking of animals with PIT/RFID chips (Casey 2014), or with cutting-edge life-history tags (e.g. Horning & Mellish 2012), only enables the post hoc identification of mortalities, but cannot support a real-time response, which lies at the heart of our proposal (for the use of real-time 'listening' stations, to detect illegal logging, see Gross 2014). We can think of many ways to tailor system specifications to suit particular species or deployment contexts, or to extend basic system functionality. For example, event-triggering could be combined very effectively with another anti-poaching technology that is currently being developed – unmanned aerial systems, or 'drones' (Marks 2013, 2014; Casey 2014; Gross 2014; Mulero-Pázmány et al. 2014). Rather than putting (tagged) animals under intermittent or constant drone surveillance, however, as currently planned, poaching-alert tags could guide drones selectively to confirmed crime scenes, for collection of still-image or video evidence until anti-poaching units arrive on the ground. Such targeted monitoring should considerably increase the effectiveness of drone-based projects, while reducing their logistical complexity and running costs. It is useful to explore briefly the practicalities of implementing our approach (cf. Table 1). Assuming that the engineering challenges of constructing suitable tags can be met, a key requirement is adequate tagging effort. Our approach aims at escalating the potential risks involved in committing poaching crimes, driving an unfavourable cost-benefit ratio for poachers. This can only be achieved if a substantial proportion of local animal populations is marked with poaching-alert tags or is at least being perceived to be marked, forcing poachers to take an increased risk, every time they pull the trigger or check a snare. It would of course be desirable if tags were difficult to see at a distance, because they are either very small or well hidden (e.g. in the horn of rhinos, or in ankle bracelets that cannot be seen in high grass; see Fig. 1), but where this is impossible (e.g. because tags need to be mounted on a collar, as with tigers), the strategic use of cheap dummy tags could considerably reduce programme costs (dummy tags are often used in biologging projects, to assess tagging effects; e.g. Bridger & Booth 2003). Trapping effort would admittedly pose significant challenges for large populations, but is unlikely to be an issue in those areas where intervention is most urgently needed: this is because critically endangered populations are often heavily managed, with large numbers of subjects being routinely trapped for ID marking (Ngene et al. 2011) and health checks. As with any new technology employed in antagonistic contexts, one particular concern is the possible development of counter measures. In our case, this could involve, for example, technology to jam tags' two-way communication with satellites. We think that such an 'arms race' is unlikely, at least in the short term, given the required levels of technological expertise, and the substantial costs involved, which would quickly diminish criminals' profit margins. For two main reasons, we are surprised that real-time poaching-alert systems have not been implemented yet. First, the fight against most other types of crime heavily relies on the use of event-triggered technology. While large-scale CCTV surveillance, and regular police patrols, may lead to reductions in crime rates (e.g. Levitt 1997), the success of policing is no doubt dramatically enhanced by systems that raise alarms in real-time and enable arrests at crime scenes. This includes house and car alarms, panic buttons and rape alarms, and perhaps most importantly, the victims' ability in many circumstances to phone the police directly. We see no reason why this powerful route of 'self-reporting' could not be emulated in the desperate fight against poaching crime. To our knowledge, this opportunity has so far been overlooked, despite increasing interest in technology-driven approaches (see above). Secondly, over the last 10 years or so, significant advances have been made in biologging science, producing tags of unprecedented miniaturization, sophistication and integration (Rutz & Hays 2009) – while major engineering challenges lie ahead (see Table 1), the construction of real-time poaching-alert systems is well within reach of current expertise. We hope others will join us in our efforts to implement the ideas outlined in this essay. To start with, we invite biologging engineers – many of whom already have keen interests in conservation biology (Cooke 2008; Bograd et al. 2010) – to collaborate with us on system development, as free sharing of expertise and other resources will be essential to making rapid progress. But, success will also depend on support from wildlife biologists and ranger teams on the ground, and on the willingness of governments and other authorities to issue permits for system deployment, to facilitate the cross-border pursuit of criminal suspects and to put in place robust legislation for the sentencing of convicted poachers (cf. Maisels et al. 2013; see Table 1). Given that many target species are fast heading towards extinction, we need to explore all available anti-poaching tools with utmost urgency, aiming for intervention at every stage of the trade chain. While we are fully aware that our reactive, technology-based approach does not provide an all-encompassing solution, it should – through its contribution to improving arrest rates and establishing an effective deterrent – buy crucial time until longer-term, preventive measures have gained sufficient traction.

While deep observations of spatially resolved molecular emission have been comparatively limited, they are increasingly suggesting that some disks interact with their surroundings while planet formation is underway. We present an analysis of complex features identified around GM Aur in 12 CO J = 2 − 1 images at a spatial resolution of ∼40 au. In addition to a Keplerian disk extending to a radius of ∼550 au, the CO emission traces flocculent spiral arms out to radii of ∼1200 au, a tail extending ∼1800 au southwest of GM Aur, and diffuse structures extending from the north side of the disk up to radii of ∼1900 au. The diffuse structures coincide with a “dust ribbon” previously identified in scattered light. The large-scale asymmetric gas features present a striking contrast with the mostly axisymmetric, multi-ringed millimeter continuum tracing the pebble disk. We hypothesize that GM Aur’s complex gas structures result from late infall of remnant envelope or cloud material onto the disk. The morphological similarities to the SU Aur and AB Aur systems, which are also located in the L1517 cloud, provide additional support to a scenario in which interactions with the environment are playing a role in regulating the distribution and transport of material in all three of these Class II disk systems.

In this paper, we investigate how the stochastic nature of these models, notably star formation, black hole accretion, and their associated feedback, that act on small (&amp;lt; kpc) scales, can back-react on macroscopic galaxy properties (e.g. stellar mass and size) across long (&amp;gt; Gyr) time-scales. We find that the scatter in scaling relations predicted by the EAGLE model implemented in the swift code can be significantly impacted by random variability between re-simulations of the same object, even when galaxies are resolved by tens of thousands of particles. We then illustrate how re-simulations of the same object can be used to better understand the underlying model, by showing how correlations between galaxy stellar mass and black hole mass disappear at the highest black hole masses (MBH &amp;gt; 108 M⊙), indicating that the feedback cycle may be interrupted by external processes. We find that although properties that are collected cumulatively over many objects are relatively robust against random variability (e.g. the median of a scaling relation), the properties of individual galaxies (such as galaxy stellar mass) can vary by up to 25 per cent, even far into the well-resolved regime, driven by bursty physics (black hole feedback), and mergers between galaxies. We suggest that studies of individual objects within cosmological simulations be treated with caution, and that any studies aiming to closely investigate such objects must account for random variability within their results.",False,0,,True,0

The structure that we investigate possesses a porous elastic matrix with embedded elastic subphases with an incompressible Newtonian fluid flowing in the pores. Both the matrix and individual subphases are assumed to be linear elastic and pre-stressed. We are able to apply the asymptotic homogenisation technique by exploiting the length-scale separation that exists between the porescale and the overall size of the material (the macroscale ). We derive the novel macroscale model which describes a poroelastic composite material where the elastic phases possess a pre-stress. We extend the current literature for poroelastic composites by addressing the role of the pre-stresses in the functional form of the new system of derived partial differential equations and its coefficients.

These spatio-temporal point processes are often sparse, meaning that they cannot be aggregated and treated with conventional regression models. Models based on the point process framework may be employed instead for prediction purposes. Evaluating the predictive performance of these models poses a unique challenge, as the same sparseness prevents the use of popular measures such as the root mean squared error. Statistical likelihood is a valid alternative, but this does not measure absolute performance and is therefore difficult for practitioners and researchers to interpret. Motivated by this limitation, we develop a practical toolkit of evaluation metrics for spatio-temporal point process predictions. The metrics are based around the concept of hotspots, which represent areas of high point density. In addition to measuring predictive accuracy, our evaluation toolkit considers broader aspects of predictive performance, including a characterisation of the spatial and temporal distributions of predicted hotspots and a comparison of the complementarity of different prediction methods. We demonstrate the application of our evaluation metrics using a case study of crime prediction, comparing four varied prediction methods using crime data from two different locations and multiple crime types. The results highlight a previously unseen interplay between predictive accuracy and spatio-temporal dispersion of predicted hotspots. The new evaluation framework may be applied to compare multiple prediction methods in a variety of scenarios, yielding valuable new insight into the predictive performance of point process-based prediction.",False,0,,True,0

Samples can be extracted from spot diameters as low as 6 μm. Studies previously undertaken by our group have shown that the technique can provide good precision (5%) for analyzing drug molecules in 150 μm diameter areas of homogenized tissue, provided an internal standard is sprayed on to the tissue prior to analysis. However, without an isotopically labeled standard, the repeatability is poor, even after normalization to the spot area or matrix compounds. By application to tissue homogenates spiked with drug compounds, we can demonstrate that it is possible to significantly improve the repeatability of the technique by incorporating a liquid chromatography separation step. Liquid chromatography is a technique for separating compounds prior to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) which enables separation of isomeric compounds that cannot be discriminated using mass spectrometry alone, as well as reducing matrix interferences. Conventionally, LC-MS is carried out on bulk or homogenized samples, which means analysis is essentially an average of the sample and does not take into account discrete areas.

Over the past century, the repeated emergence of coffee wilt disease caused by the fungal pathogen Fusarium xylarioides severely impacted coffee production across sub-Saharan Africa. To improve the disease management of such pathogens, it is crucial to understand their genetic structure and evolutionary potential. We compared the genomes of 13 historic strains spanning 6 decades and multiple disease outbreaks to investigate population structure and host specialisation. We found that F . xylarioides comprised at least 4 distinct lineages: 1 host-specific to Coffea arabica , 1 to C . canephora var. robusta, and 2 historic lineages isolated from various Coffea species. The presence/absence of large genomic regions across populations, the higher genetic similarities of these regions between species than expected based on genome-wide divergence and their locations in different loci in genomes across populations showed that horizontal transfers of effector genes from members of the F . oxysporum species complex contributed to host specificity. Multiple transfers into F . xylarioides populations matched different parts of the F . oxysporum mobile pathogenicity chromosome and were enriched in effector genes and transposons. Effector genes in this region and other carbohydrate-active enzymes important in the breakdown of plant cell walls were shown by transcriptomics to be highly expressed during infection of C . arabica by the fungal arabica strains. Widespread sharing of specific transposons between F . xylarioides and F . oxysporum , and the correspondence of a putative horizontally transferred regions to a Starship (large mobile element involved in horizontal gene transfers in fungi), reinforce the inference of horizontal transfers and suggest that mobile elements were involved. Our results support the hypothesis that horizontal gene transfers contributed to the repeated emergence of coffee wilt disease.",False,0,,True,0

However, ultrasonically estimated large for gestational age (LGA; &amp;gt;90th percentile) predicts these complications poorly. Objective To determine whether a maternal serum metabolite ratio developed for fetal growth restriction (FGR) is predictive of birth weight across the whole range, including LGA at birth. Methods Metabolites were measured using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy. The 4-metabolite ratio was previously derived from an analysis of FGR cases and a random subcohort from the Pregnancy Outcome Prediction study. Here, we evaluated its relationship at 36 weeks of gestational age (wkGA) with birth weight in the subcohort (n = 281). External validation in the Born in Bradford (BiB) study (n = 2366) used the metabolite ratio at 24 to 28 wkGA. Results The inverse of the metabolite ratio at 36 wkGA predicted LGA at term [the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCC) = 0.82, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.91, P = 6.7 × 10−5]. The ratio was also inversely associated with birth weight z score (linear regression, beta = −0.29 SD, P = 2.1 × 10−8). Analysis in the BiB cohort confirmed that the ratio at 24 to 28 wkGA predicted LGA (AUROCC = 0.60, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.67, P = 8.6 × 10−5) and was inversely associated with birth weight z score (beta = −0.12 SD, P = 1.3 × 10−9).

Western disturbances (WDs) are synoptic-scale weather systems embedded within the subtropical westerly jet. Manifesting as upper-level troughs often associated with a lower-tropospheric low over Western India, they share some dynamical features with extratropical cyclones. WDs are most common during the boreal winter (December to March), during which they bring the majority of precipitation – both rain and snow – to the Western Himalaya, as well as to surrounding areas of north India, Pakistan and the Tibetan Plateau. WDs are also associated with weather hazards such as heavy snowfall, hailstorms, fog, cloudbursts, avalanches, frost, and coldwaves. In this paper, we review the recent understanding and development on WDs. Recent studies have collectively made use of novel data, novel analysis techniques, and the increasing availability of high-resolution weather and climate models. This review is separated into six main sections – structure and thermodynamics, precipitation and impacts, teleconnections, modelling experiments, forecasting at a range of scales, and paleoclimate and climate change – each motivated with a brief discussion of the accomplishments and limitations of previous research. A number of step changes in understanding are synthesised. Use of new modelling frameworks and tracking algorithms has significantly improved knowledge of WD structure and variability, and a more frequentist approach can now be taken. Improved observation systems have helped quantification of water security over the Western Himalaya. Convection-permitting models have improved our understanding of how WDs interact with the Himalayas to trigger natural hazards. Improvements in paleoclimate and future climate modelling experiments have helped to explain how WDs and their impacts over the Himalaya respond to large-scale natural and anthropogenic forcings. We end by summarising unresolved questions and outlining key future WD research topics.",False,0,,True,1

We present numerical evidence that a continuous energy spectrum of the supersymmetric model leads to monotonous growth of OTOCs down to the lowest temperatures, a property that is also expected for the BFSS model from holographic duality. We find that this growth is saturated by low-energy eigenstates with effectively one-dimensional wave functions and a completely nonchaotic energy level distribution. We observe a sharp boundary separating these low-energy states from the bulk of chaotic high-energy states. Our data suggest, although with limited confidence, that at low temperatures the OTOC growth might be exponential over a finite range of time, with the corresponding Lyapunov exponent scaling linearly with temperature. In contrast, the gapped low-energy spectrum of the bosonic Hamiltonian leads to oscillating OTOCs at low temperatures without any signatures of exponential growth. We also find that the OTOCs for the bosonic Hamiltonian are never sufficiently close to the classical Lyapunov distance. On the other hand, the OTOCs for the supersymmetric system agree with the classical limit reasonably well over a finite range of temperatures and evolution times.",False,0,,True,0

In these years, photocatalysis that uses solar energy for either fuel production, such as hydrogen evolution and hydrocarbon production, or environmental pollutant degradation, has shown great potential to achieve this goal. Among the various photocatalysts, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are very attractive due to their excellent structural regularity, robust framework, inherent porosity and good activity. Thus, many studies have been carried out to investigate the photocatalytic performance of COFs and COF-based photocatalysts. In this critical review, the recent progress and advances of COF photocatalysts are thoroughly presented. Furthermore, diverse linkers between COF building blocks such as boron-containing connections and nitrogen-containing connections are summarised and compared. The morphologies of COFs and several commonly used strategies pertaining to photocatalytic activity are also discussed. Following this, the applications of COF-based photocatalysts are detailed including photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, CO2 conversion and degradation of environmental contaminants. Finally, a summary and perspective on the opportunities and challenges for the future development of COF and COF-based photocatalysts are given.",False,0,,True,0

This coupling is enhanced at substorm onset through the formation of the substorm current wedge. Using FAC data from the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment and substorm expansion phase onsets identified using the Substorm Onsets and Phases from Indices of the Electrojet technique, we examine the Northern Hemisphere FACs in all local time sectors with respect to substorm onset and subdivided by season. Our results show that while there is a strong seasonal dependence on the underlying FACs, the increase in FACs following substorm onset only varies by 10% with season, with substorms increasing the hemispheric FACs by 420 kA on average. Over an hour prior to substorm onset, the dayside currents in the postnoon quadrant increase linearly, whereas the nightside currents show a linear increase starting 20–30 min before onset.

We determined prevalence and diversity of influenza A viruses in chickens from live bird markets (LBM) of 7 northern Vietnamese provinces, using pooled oropharyngeal swabs collected from October to December 2014. Screening by real time RT-PCR revealed 1207/4900 (24.6%) of pooled swabs to be influenza A virus positive; overall prevalence estimates after accounting for pooling (5 swabs/pools) were 5.8% (CI 5.4-6.0). Subtyping was performed on 468 pooled swabs with M gene Ct<26. No influenza H7 was detected; 422 (90.1%) were H9 positive; and 22 (4.7%) were H5 positive. There was no evidence was of interaction between H9 and H5 virus detection rates. We sequenced 17 whole genomes of A/H9N2, 2 of A/H5N6, and 11 partial genomes. All H9N2 viruses had internal genes that clustered with genotype 57 and were closely related to Chinese human isolates of A/H7N9 and A/H10N8. Using a nucleotide divergence cutoff of 98%, we identified 9 distinct H9 genotypes.

For its part, however, the sociology of the everyday has tended to be remarkably blind to the role played by racism and racialization in the modern world. It is thus no less crucial to consider how the experiences of racialized groups might help us rethink influential accounts of the everyday.

As a remarkable effect, we show that the stationary state has a strongly discontinuous dependence on the strength of interaction as confirmed by the exact analytic expression of the Drude weight that we compute. These features allow us to give a qualitative estimation for the transient behavior of the current which is in good agreement with numerical simulations. Moreover, we analyze the behavior around the edge of the magnetization profile, and we argue that, unlike the $XX$ free-fermionic point, interactions always prevent the emergence of a Tracy-Widom scaling.",False,0,,True,0

The simulation forms a bar after redshift z = 0.2. We show that the evolution of the model exhibits behaviours typical of kinematic fractionation, with a bar weaker in older populations, an X-shape traced by the younger, metal-rich populations, and a prominent X-shape in the edge-on mean metallicity map. Because of the late formation of the bar in m12m, stars forming after $10\mbox{$\:{\rm Gyr}$}$ (z = 0.34) significantly contaminate the bulge, at a level higher than is observed at high latitudes in the Milky Way, implying that its bar cannot have formed as late as in m12m. We also study the model’s vertex deviation of the velocity ellipsoid as a function of stellar metallicity and age in the equivalent of Baade’s Window. The formation of the bar leads to a non-zero vertex deviation. We find that metal-rich stars have a large vertex deviation (∼40°), which becomes negligible for metal-poor stars, a trend also found in the Milky Way, despite not matching in detail. We demonstrate that the vertex deviation also varies with stellar age and is large for stars as old as $9 \mbox{$\:{\rm Gyr}$}$, while $13\mbox{$\:{\rm Gyr}$}$ old stars have negligible vertex deviation. When we exclude stars that have been accreted, the vertex deviation is not significantly changed, demonstrating that the observed variation of vertex deviation with metallicity is not necessarily due to an accreted population.",False,0,,True,0

However, tailoring the growth mechanism of AuNPs on an identical surface is not straightforward. In this study, AuNPs were deposited on the surface of a perovskite thin film, strontium niobate (SNO), using pulsed laser deposition (PLD). AuNPs exhibited a dramatic variation in their growth mechanisms, depending on whether they were deposited on SNO thin films grown on magnesium oxide (SNO/MgO) or strontium titanate (SNO/STO) substrates. On SNO/MgO, the Au aggregates form large NPs with an average size of up to 3500 nm2. These AuNPs are triangular with sharp edges and corners. The out-of-plane direction of growth is favored, and the surface coverage ratio by AuNPs is low. When deposited on SNO/STO, the average size of AuNPs is much smaller, i.e., ∼250 nm2. This reduction in the average size is accompanied by an increase in the number density of NPs. AuNPs on SNO/STO have a round shape and high coverage ratio. Such an impact from the substrate selection on the AuNP structure is significant when the sandwiched SNO film is below 80 nm thickness and is weakened for 200 nm of SNO films. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize all samples. Strain analysis was used to explain the growth mechanism of AuNPs.

Excellent agreement is seen between the techniques with a maximum in both the relative absorption coefficient and the activation energy to molecular motion occurring at ∼90 mol% H2O. Furthermore, this is the same value at which well-established excess thermodynamic functions exhibit a maximum/minimum. Additionally, both neutron diffraction and THz-TDS have been used to provide estimates of the size of the hydration shell around 2-propanol in solution. Both methods determine that between 4 and 5 H2O molecules per 2-propanol are found in the 2-propanol/water clusters at 90 mol% H2O.

The ER consists of a dynamic and continuously remodelling network of tubules and cisternae. Several conserved membrane proteins have been implicated in formation and maintenance of the ER network in plants, such as RHD3 and the reticulon family of proteins. Despite the recent work in mammalian and yeast cells, the detailed molecular mechanisms of ER network organisation in plants still remain largely unknown. Recently novel ER network-shaping proteins called Lunapark have been identified in yeast and mammalian cells. Here we identify two arabidopsis LNP homologues and investigate their subcellular localisation via confocal microscopy and potential function in shaping the ER network using protein-protein interaction assays and mutant analysis. We show that AtLNP1 overexpression in tobacco leaf epidermal cells mainly labels the three-way junctions (trivia) of the ER network whereas AtLNP2 labels the whole ER. Overexpression of LNP proteins results in an increased abundance of ER cisternae and an lnp1lnp2 amiRNA line displays a less structured ER network. Thus, we hypothesize that AtLNP1 and AtLNP2 are involved in determining the dynamic morphology of the plant ER, possibly by regulating the formation of ER cisternae.",False,0,,True,0

Such an approach has allowed the confirmation of a lipid core within the HTL, which accommodates between 8 and 29 lipids. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of the HTL also demonstrate a dynamic, central pool of lipids.

Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), which consists of both the pro- and anti-angiogenic variants, contributes to the pathogenesis of IH. However, the roles of different VEGF-A variants in IH progression and its spontaneous involution is unknown. Using patient-derived cells and surgical specimens, we showed that the relative level of VEGF-A165 b was increased in the involuting phase of IH and the relative change in VEGF-A isoforms may be dependent on endothelial differentiation of IH stem cells. VEGFR signalling regulated IH cell functions and VEGF-A165 b inhibited cell proliferation and the angiogenic potential of IH endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. The inhibition of angiogenesis by VEGF-A165 b was associated with the extent of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) activation and degradation and Delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4) expression. These results indicate that VEGF-A variants can be regulated by cell differentiation and are involved in IH progression. We also demonstrated that DLL4 expression was not exclusive to the endothelium in IH but was also present in pericytes, where the expression of VEGFR2 is absent, suggesting that pericyte-derived DLL4 may prevent sprouting during involution, independently of VEGFR2. Angiogenesis in IH therefore appears to be controlled by DLL4 within the endothelium in a VEGF-A isoform-dependent manner, and in perivascular cells in a VEGF-independent manner. The contribution of VEGF-A isoforms to disease progression also indicates that IH may be associated with altered splicing. © 2016 The Authors.

In this work, the properties of thermal failure and its effects on electrode materials were investigated in a commercial battery using a combination of accelerating rate calorimetry (ARC) and multi-length scale X-ray computed tomography (CT). ARC measured the heat dissipated from the cell during thermal runaway and enabled the identification of key thermal failure characteristics such as onset temperature and the rate of heat generation during the failure. Analysis before and after failure using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray CT were performed to reveal the effects of failure on the architecture of the whole cell and microstructure of the cathode material. Mechanical deformations to the cell architecture were revealed due to gas generation at elevated temperatures (&gt;200 °C). The extreme conditions during thermal runaway caused the cathode particles to reduce in size by a factor of two. Electrode surface analysis revealed surface deposits on both the anode and cathode materials. The link between electrode microstructure and heat generation within a cell during failure is analysed and compared to commercially available lithium ion cells of varying cathode chemistries.

For instance, the three-wave mixing process has been employed to great success in narrow-linewidth lasers, sensing applications, microscopy, and signal processing. While most of these avenues focus on room temperature operation, there is now increasing interest in cryogenic operation owing to the scattering mechanism’s significant potential for applications and fundamental physics at low temperatures. Here, we measure the Brillouin scattering spectrum in standard single-mode telecommunication optical fibers at millikelvin temperatures using a closed-cycle dilution refrigerator and optical heterodyne detection. Our experiments are performed with a cryostat temperature from 50 mK to 27 K, extending previously reported measurements that utilized liquid helium-4 cryostats with temperatures greater than 1 K. At millikelvin temperatures, our experiment observes coherent acoustic interactions with microscopic defects in the amorphous material—two-level-systems (TLSs)—which has not been previously observed in optical fibers. The measured behavior of the linewidth with temperature is in agreement with the well-established models of ultrasonic attenuation in amorphous materials comprising a background intrinsic scattering, thermally activated scattering, and incoherent and coherent TLS interactions.

Thanks to the PyPSA power system modelling tool combined with a sensitivity study, optimized rSOC system capacities, hydrogen storage capacities, and subsea cable connection capacities are investigated under various combinations of rSOC system capital cost, prices paid for hydrogen, and electricity prices, which give indications on the most profitable scenario for offshore hydrogen production from a 600 MW wind farm situated 60 km from shore. Low electricity prices (yearly average 45 £/MWh) combined with mild fluctuations (standard deviation 6 or 13 £/MWh) call for dedicated hydrogen production when the hydrogen price exceeds 4 £/kg. High electricity prices (yearly average 118 or 204 £/MWh), combined with extreme fluctuations (standard deviation between 73 and 110 £/MWh), make a reversible system economically profitable. The amount of hydrogen which is recommended to be reconverted into electricity depends on the price paid for hydrogen. Comparison of the optimized cases to the default case of a wind farm without hydrogen production improved profit by at least 3% and up to 908%. Comparison to the default case of dedicated hydrogen production, showed that in the case of low hydrogen prices, an unprofitable scenario can be made profitable, and improvement of profit in the case of a profitable default case starts at 4% and reaches numbers as high as 324%.",False,0,,True,0

However, through differential pre-mRNA splicing analysis, we discovered a cancer-enriched, non-annotated 51-nucleotide exon in TLN1 between exons 17 and 18, which we refer to as exon 17b. TLN1 is comprised of an N-terminal FERM domain, linked to 13 force-dependent switch domains, R1-R13. Inclusion of exon 17b introduces an in-frame insertion of 17 amino acids immediately after Gln665 in the region between R1 and R2 which lowers the force required to open the R1-R2 switches potentially altering downstream mechanotransduction.

Many of the most commonly applied cosmogenic nuclides are extracted from the mineral quartz, meaning sampling of felsic (silica-rich) rock is often preferred to sampling of mafic (silica-poor) rock for exposure dating studies. Fieldwork in remote regions such as Antarctica is subject to time constraints and considerable logistical challenges, making efficient sample recovery critical to successful research efforts. Remote sensing offers an effective way to map the geology of large areas prior to fieldwork and expedite the sampling process. In this study, we assess the viability of multispectral remote sensing to distinguish felsic from mafic rock outcrops at visible-near infrared (VNIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) wavelengths using both the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and very high-resolution Worldview-3 (WV-3) imagery. We applied a combination of spectral mapping and ground truth from spectral measurements of 17 rock samples from Mount Murphy in the Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica. Using this approach, we identified four dominant rock types which we used as a basis for felsic–mafic differentiation: felsic granites and gneisses, and mafic basalts and fragmental hydrovolcanic rocks. Supervised classification results indicate WV-3 performs well at differentiating felsic and mafic rock types and that ASTER, while coarser, could also achieve satisfactory results and be used in concert with more targeted WV-3 image acquisitions. Finally, we present a revised felsic–mafic geological map for Mt Murphy. Overall, our results highlight the potential of spectral mapping for preliminary reconnaissance when planning future cosmogenic nuclide sampling campaigns in remote, unvisited areas of the polar regions.",False,0,,True,0

A recent mathematical breakthrough has clarified their mathematical structure and has opened up the possibility of a systematic analysis. Early investigations have found evidence that these constraints are exactly saturated in several physically relevant systems, e.g., in a certain electronic state of the beryllium atom. It has been suggested that, in such cases, the constraints, rather than the details of the Hamiltonian, dictate the system's qualitative behavior. Here, we revisit this question with state-of-the-art numerical methods for small atoms. We find that the constraints are, in fact, not exactly saturated, but that they lie much closer to the surface defined by the constraints than the geometry of the problem would suggest. While the results seem incompatible with the statement that the generalized Pauli constraints drive the behavior of these systems, they suggest that the qualitatively correct wave-function expansions can in some systems already be obtained on the basis of a limited number of Slater determinants, which is in line with numerical evidence from quantum chemistry.",False,0,,True,0

Cartilage thickness distribution is one factor influencing the distribution of pressure. Precision of cartilage geometry capture varies between imaging protocols. This work evaluated the cartilage thickness distribution precision needed for contact mechanics prediction in models of the tibiofemoral joint by comparing model outputs to experimental measurements for three cadaveric specimens. Models with location-specific cartilage thickness were compared to those with a uniform thickness, for a fixed relative orientation of the femur and tibia and with tibial freedom of movement. Under constrained conditions, the advantage of including location-specific cartilage thickness was clear. Models with location-specific thickness predicted the proportion of force through each condyle with an average error of 5% (compared to 27% with uniform thickness) and predicted the experimental contact area with an error of 21 mm 2 (compared to 98 mm 2 with uniform thickness). With tibial freedom, the advantage of location-specific cartilage thickness not clear. The attempt to allow three degrees of relative freedom at the tibiofemoral joint resulted in a high degree of experimental and computational uncertainty. It is therefore recommended that researchers avoid this level of freedom. This work provides some evidence that highly constrained conditions make tibiofemoral contact mechanics predictions more sensitive to cartilage thickness and should perhaps be avoided in studies where the means to generate subject-specific cartilage thickness are not available.",False,0,,True,0

This carbohydrate is subject to microbial fermentation and can radically change bacterial populations in the colon and the metabolites they produce, particularly short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). However, very little is currently known about the forms and levels of carbohydrate in the ileum and the composition of the ileal microbiota in humans. Most of our current understanding of carbohydrate that is not absorbed by the small intestine comes from ileostomy models, which may not reflect the physiology of an intact gastrointestinal tract.</ns3:p><ns3:p> <ns3:bold>Methods:</ns3:bold> We will investigate how ileal content changes depending on diet using a randomised crossover study in healthy humans. Participants will be inpatients at the research facility for three separate 4-day visits. During each visit, participants will consume one of three diets, which differ in carbohydrate quality: 1) low-fibre refined diet; 2) high-fibre diet with intact cellular structures; 3) high-fibre diet where the cellular structures have been disrupted (e.g. milling, blending). On day 1, a nasoenteric tube will be placed into the distal ileum and its position confirmed under fluoroscopy. Ileal samples will be collected via the nasoenteric tube and metabolically profiled, which will determine the amount and type of carbohydrate present, and the composition of the ileal microbiota will be measured. Blood samples will be collected to assess circulating hormones and metabolites. Stool samples will be collected to assess faecal microbiota composition. Subjective appetite measures will be collected using visual analogue scales. Breath hydrogen will be measured in real-time as a marker of intestinal fermentation. Finally, an <ns3:italic>in vitro</ns3:italic> continuous fermentation model will be inoculated with ileal fluid in order to understand the shift in microbial composition and SCFA produced in the colon following the different diets.</ns3:p><ns3:p> <ns3:bold>Registration:</ns3:bold> <ns3:ext-link xmlns:ns4=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" ext-link-type=""uri"" ns4:href=""http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN11327221"">ISRCTN11327221</ns3:ext-link>.</ns3:p>",False,0,,True,0

While antenna-based ""RFID"" sensing can detect various measurands, antenna-based sensors are not currently designed based on a systematic methodology, and in most cases may have a low sensitivity requiring specialist hardware or broadband interrogation signals, incompatible with spectrum regulations. Here, we develop a systematic methodology for designing an antenna-based sensor, applicable to measurands inducing a dielectric change in the near-field of the antenna. The proposed methodology is applied to designing printable antennas as highly-sensitive sensors for detecting and measuring the thickness of ice, demonstrating best-in-class sensory response compared to more complex antenna designs. Antenna design is investigated systematically for wireless interrogation in the 2.4 GHz band, where it is found that a loop antenna outperforms a dipole owing to its more distributed capacitance. The antenna's realized gain was identified as the optimum parameter-under-test, with ""positive"" sensing proposed as a method of improving linearity and immunity to interference. The developed loop antenna sensor exhibits resilience to interference and applicability to different real-world deployment environments, demonstrated through over 80% average ice thickness measurement accuracy and at least 5 dB real-time sensitivity to ice deposition.",False,0,,True,0

Considerable progress has been made in investigating fungal degradation during time-points where CAZyme expression peaks. However, a robust understanding of the fungal survival strategies over its life time on lignocellulose is thereby missed. Here we aimed to uncover the physiological responses of the biotechnological workhorse and enzyme producer Aspergillus niger over its life time to six substrates important for biofuel production. We analysed the response of A. niger to the feedstock Miscanthus and compared it with our previous study on wheat straw, alone or in combination with hydrothermal or ionic liquid feedstock pretreatments. Conserved (substrate-independent) metabolic responses as well as those affected by pretreatment and feedstock were identified via multivariate analysis of genome-wide transcriptomics combined with targeted transcript and protein analyses and mapping to a metabolic model. Initial exposure to all substrates increased fatty acid beta-oxidation and lipid metabolism transcripts. In a strain carrying a deletion of the ortholog of the Aspergillus nidulans fatty acid beta-oxidation transcriptional regulator farA, there was a reduction in expression of selected lignocellulose degradative CAZyme-encoding genes suggesting that beta-oxidation contributes to adaptation to lignocellulose. Mannan degradation expression was wheat straw feedstock-dependent and pectin degradation was higher on the untreated substrates. In the later life stages, known and novel secondary metabolite gene clusters were activated, which are of high interest due to their potential to synthesize bioactive compounds. In this study, which includes the first transcriptional response of Aspergilli to Miscanthus, we highlighted that life time as well as substrate composition and structure (via variations in pretreatment and feedstock) influence the fungal responses to lignocellulose. We also demonstrated that the fungal response contains physiological stages that are conserved across substrates and are typically found outside of the conditions with high CAZyme expression, as exemplified by the stages that are dominated by lipid and secondary metabolism.",False,0,,True,0

While high throughput metagenomic sequencing reveals genotypes of microbial communities, the functionality, phenotype and heterogeneity of human gut microbiota are still elusive. In this study, we applied Raman microscopy and deuterium isotope probing (Raman–DIP) to detect metabolic active ARB (MA‐ARB) in situ at the single‐cell level in human gut microbiota from two healthy adults. We analysed the relative abundances of MA‐ARB under different concentrations of amoxicillin, cephalexin, tetracycline, florfenicol and vancomycin. To establish the link between phenotypes and genotypes of the MA‐ARB, Raman‐activated cell sorting (RACS) was used to sort MA‐ARB from human gut microbiota, and mini‐metagenomic DNA of the sorted bacteria was amplified, sequenced and analysed. The sorted MA‐ARB and their associated ARGs were identified. Our results suggest a strong relation between ARB in human gut microbiota and personal medical history. This study demonstrates that the toolkit of Raman–DIP, RACS and DNA sequencing can be useful to unravel both phenotypes and genotypes of ARB in human gut microbiota at the single‐cell level.",False,0,,True,0

These project to the primary olfactory cortex including the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON), the piriform cortex, amygdala, and the entorhinal cortex. The properties of mitral cells have been investigated extensively, but how odor information is processed in subsequent brain regions is less well known. In the present study, we recorded the electrical activity of AON neurons in anesthetized rats. Most AON cells fired in bursts of 2-10 spikes separated by very short intervals (<20 ms), in a period linked to the respiratory rhythm. Simultaneous recordings from adjacent neurons revealed that the rhythms of adjacent cells, while locked to the same underlying rhythm, showed marked differences in phase. We studied the responses of AON cells to brief high-frequency stimulation of the lateral olfactory tract, mimicking brief activation of mitral cells by odor. In different cells, such stimuli evoked transient or sustained bursts during stimulation or, more commonly, post-stimulation bursts after inhibition during stimulation. This suggests that, in AON cells, phase shifts occur as a result of post-inhibitory rebound firing, following inhibition by mitral cell input, and we discuss how this supports processing of odor information in the olfactory pathway.

Microplastics were ubiquitous with particles detected in every animal examined. The relatively low number per animal (mean = 5.5) suggests these particles are transitory.

This study aimed to examine the impact of multimorbidity, smoking status, and demographics (age, ethnic group, area of deprivation) on vaccine hesitancy among pregnant women in Wales using electronic health records (EHR) linkage. Methods This cohort study utilised routinely collected, individual-level, anonymised population-scale linked data within the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. Pregnant women were identified from 13th April 2021 to 31st December 2021. Survival analysis was employed to examine and compare the length of time to vaccination uptake in pregnancy by considering multimorbidity, smoking status, as well as depression, diabetes, asthma, and cardiovascular conditions independently. The study also assessed the variation in uptake by multimorbidity, smoking status, and demographics, both jointly and separately for the independent conditions, using hazard ratios (HR) derived from the Cox regression model. Results Within the population cohort, 8,203 (32.7%) received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy, with 8,572 (34.1%) remaining unvaccinated throughout the follow-up period, and 8,336 (33.2%) receiving the vaccine postpartum. Women aged 30 years or older were more likely to have the vaccine in pregnancy. Those who had depression were slightly but significantly more likely to have the vaccine compared to those without depression (HR = 1.08, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.14, p = 0.002). Women living with multimorbidity were 1.12 times more likely to have the vaccine compared to those living without multimorbidity (HR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.19, p = 0.001). Vaccine uptakes were significantly lower among both current smokers and former smokers compared to never smokers (HR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.94, p &lt; 0.001 and HR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.98, p = 0.015 respectively). Uptake was also lower among those living in the most deprived areas compared to those living in the most affluent areas (HR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.96, p = 0.002). Conclusion Younger women, living without multimorbidity, current and former smokers, and those living in the more deprived areas are less likely to have the vaccine, thus, a targeted approach to vaccinations may be required for these groups. Pregnant individuals living with multimorbidity exhibit a slight but statistically significant reduction in vaccine hesitancy towards COVID-19 during pregnancy.",False,0,,True,0

The poor current understanding of the behaviour of chips in such processes limits the likelihood of practical adoption of such materials on an industrial scale. The re-use (as opposed to recycling or landfilling) of machining waste offers both economic and environmental savings. Iron and steel production causes up to 9 %, and aluminium up to 1.5 % of global process and energy CO2 emissions. It is proposed that between 0.24 % and 0.5 % (117 Mt CO2) of global CO2 emissions could be saved by reusing steel machining chips and between 0.13 % and 0.22 % (51 Mt CO2) via re-use of aluminium chips, through mitigation of recycling associated emissions or emissions from generation of new steel. Re-use of large manufacturing scrap, i.e. the majority of such scrap, increases these values to savings of 1 % and 0.86 % of global CO2 emissions for steel and aluminium respectively in the best scenario. This work gives a perspective on the potential for chips to retain value and be re-used in manufacturing process streams. The paper guides the reader from the generation and control of machining chips, to the principles of material consolidation. The principles of material densification by both solid state and laser deposition based methods are described, and current and potential manufacturing processes which can use chips as a feedstock are critically reviewed in terms of their practicalities and final properties. A perspective on potential CO2 savings is described, providing the underpinning motivation behind this work. It is shown there is significant potential for versatile manufacturing using machining chips by both solid-state and laser-based processing of chips into finished products. An argument is also presented for a new approach to processing large-scrap, e.g. from the automotive manufacturing industry, as well as end-of-life automotive scrap, into smaller chips ready for re-use.",False,0,,True,0

This transient was discovered by the Lick Observatory Supernova Search in 2012 and has continued its outbursts since then. Optical and infrared photometry of AT 2016blu reveals at least 19 outbursts in 2012–2022. Similar photometry from 1999 to 2009 shows no outbursts, indicating that the star was relatively stable in the decade before discovery. Archival Hubble Space Telescope observations suggest that the progenitor had a minimum initial mass of $M \gtrsim 33$ M⊙ and a luminosity of $L \gtrsim 10^{5.7}$ L⊙. AT 2016blu’s outbursts show irregular variability with multiple closely spaced peaks having typical amplitudes of 1–2 mag and durations of 1–4 weeks. While individual outbursts have irregular light curves, concentrations of these peaks recur with a period of ∼113 ± 2 d. Based on this period, we predict upcoming outbursts in 2023 and 2024. AT 2016blu shares similarities with SN 2000ch in NGC 3432, where outbursts may arise from periastron encounters in an eccentric binary containing a luminous blue variable (LBV). We propose that AT 2016blu’s outbursts are also driven by interactions that intensify around periastron in an eccentric system. Intrinsic variability of the LBV-like primary star may cause different intensity and duration of binary interaction at each periastron passage. AT 2016blu also resembles the periastron encounters of η Carinae prior to its Great Eruption and the erratic pre-SN eruptions of SN 2009ip. This similarity and the onset of eruptions in the past decade hint that AT 2016blu may also be headed for a catastrophe, making it a target of great interest.",False,0,,True,0

Using two‐sample Mendelian randomization, we assessed the association of metabolically unfavourable adiposity (UFA), favourable adiposity (FA) and for comparison body mass index (BMI), with prostate cancer, including aggressive prostate cancer. Methods We examined the association of these genetically predicted adiposity‐related traits with risk of prostate cancer overall, aggressive and early onset disease using outcome summary statistics from the PRACTICAL consortium (including 15,167 aggressive cases). Results In inverse‐variance weighted models, there was little evidence that genetically predicted one standard deviation higher UFA, FA and BMI were associated with aggressive prostate cancer [OR: 0.85 (95% CI:0.61–1.19), 0.80 (0.53–1.23) and 0.97 (0.88–1.08), respectively]; these associations were largely consistent in sensitivity analyses accounting for horizontal pleiotropy. There was no strong evidence that genetically determined UFA, FA or BMI were associated with overall prostate cancer or early age of onset prostate cancer. Conclusions We did not find differences in the associations of UFA and FA with prostate cancer risk, which suggest that adiposity is unlikely to influence prostate cancer via the metabolic factors assessed; however, these did not cover some aspects related to metabolic health that may link obesity with aggressive prostate cancer, which should be explored in future studies.",False,0,,True,0

Consequently, traditional methods rely on phylogenetic reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a model-based approach to the problem through the analysis of language change as a stochastic process combining vertical descent, spatial interactions, and mutations in both dimensions. A notion of linguistic temperature emerges naturally from this analysis as a dimensionless measure of the propensity of a linguistic feature to undergo change. We demonstrate how temperatures of linguistic features can be inferred from their present-day geospatial distributions, without recourse to information about their phylogenies. Thus the evolutionary dynamics of language, operating across thousands of years, leaves a measurable geospatial signature. This signature licenses inferences about the historical evolution of languages even in the absence of longitudinal data.",False,0,,True,0

It is not fully understood why surgery in some patients is unsuccessful. Comparing interictal MEG bandpower from patients to normative maps, which describe healthy spatial and population variability, we identify patient specific abnormalities relating to surgical failure. We propose three mechanisms contributing to poor surgical outcome; 1) failure to resect abnormalities, 2) failing to remove all epileptogenic abnormalities, and 3) insufficiently impacting the overall cortical abnormality. We develop markers of these mechanisms, validating them against patient outcomes. Resting-state MEG data were acquired for 70 healthy controls and 32 patients with refractory neocortical epilepsy. Relative bandpower maps were computed using source localised recordings from healthy controls. Patient and region-specific bandpower abnormalities were estimated as the maximum absolute z-score, using healthy data as a baseline. Resected regions were identified from post-operative MRI. We hypothesised our mechanism markers would discriminate patient's post-surgery seizure outcomes. Mechanisms of surgical failure discriminate surgical outcome groups (Abnormalities not targeted: AUC=0.80, Partial resection of the epileptogenic zone: AUC=0.68, Insufficient cortical abnormality impact: AUC=0.64). Leveraging all markers together found that 95% of those who were not seizure free had markers of surgical failure in at least one of the three proposed mechanisms. In contrast, of those patients markers for any mechanism, 80% were seizure-free. Abnormality mapping across the brain is important for a wide range of neurological conditions. Here we demonstrated that interictal MEG bandpower mapping has merit for localising pathology and improving our mechanistic understanding of epilepsy.",False,0,,True,1

For the as-polished sample, structural change was limited to the near surface region. Underneath the as-machined surface, large pores were filled with crushed material; graphite crystals were split into multi-layered graphene units that were rearranged through kinking. Graphite crystal refinement in the sub-surface region, measured by La, showed an exponential relationship with depth (z) to a depth of 35–40 μm. The positive shift of the G band in the Raman spectrum indicates a residual compression accompanied by refinement with the highest average of ~2.5 GPa on top, followed by an exponential decay inside the refined region; beyond that depth, the compression decreased linearly down to a depth of ~200 μm. Mechanisms for the refinement and residual compression are discussed with the support of atomistic modelling.",False,0,,True,0

Three relevant electrolyte concentrations, ranging between 1 and 5 molal, are studied. Impedance measurements are performed in symmetrical cells with two identical electrodes, which overcome complications associated with the contributions of the counter-reference electrode. The electrolyte-filled carbon-sulfur composite electrodes can be represented by an ""open"" Warburg element, modelling the finite-diffusion of ions through the pores coupled to the double-layer charging of the electrode-electrolyte interface. The carbon-sulfur composite electrodes are at a high enough potential (ca. 3 V vs. Li+/Li) so that charge-transfer reactions of sulfur reduction to polysulfide species are absent during the impedance measurements, and hence capacitive-like behavior is observed at low frequencies. The analysis of the results shows that the rate of transport of ions through porous structures is markedly dependent on the electrode's structure and composition as well as the electrolyte concentration. Synergistic effects, able to enhance the effective conductivity of the electrolyte inside porous composite electrodes, are observed for particular electrode/electrolyte combinations, which are correlated to enhanced performance in Li-S cells.",False,0,,True,0

We present a compilation of GPS time series, including those for previously unpublished sites, showing that flow across the entire Ronne Ice Shelf and its adjoining ice streams is strongly affected by ocean tides. Previous observations have shown strong horizontal diurnal and semidiurnal motion of the ice shelf, and surface flow speeds of Rutford Ice Stream (RIS) are known to vary with a fortnightly (Msf) periodicity. Our new data set shows that the Msf flow modulation, first observed on RIS, is also found on Evans, Talutis, Institute, and Foundation ice streams, i.e. on all ice streams for which data are available. The amplitude of the Msf signal increases downstream of grounding lines, reaching up to 20 % of mean flow speeds where ice streams feed into the main ice shelf. Upstream of ice stream grounding lines, decay length scales are relatively uniform for all ice streams but the speed at which the Msf signal propagates upstream shows more variation. Observations and modelling of tidal variations in ice flow can help constrain crucial parameters that determine the rate and extent of potential ice mass loss from Antarctica. Given that the Msf modulation in ice flow is readily observed across the entire region at distances of up to 80 km upstream of grounding lines, but is not completely reproduced in any existing numerical model, this new data set suggests a pressing need to identify the missing processes responsible for its generation and propagation. The new GPS data set is publicly available through the UK Polar Data Centre at http://doi.org/10.5285/4fe11286-0e53-4a03-854c-a79a44d1e356.",False,0,,True,0

We present a new method to constrain quasar halo masses based on the line-of-sight velocity dispersion maps of Ly α nebulae. By using MUSE-like mock observations obtained from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations under the assumption of maximal quasar fluorescence, we show that the velocity dispersion radial profiles of Ly α emitting gas are strongly determined by gravity and that they are thus self-similar with respect to halo mass when rescaled by the virial radius. Through simple analytical arguments and by exploiting the kinematics of He ii1640 Å emission for a set of observed nebulae, we show that Ly α radiative transfer effects plausibly do not change the shape of the velocity dispersion profiles but only their normalization without breaking their self-similarity. Taking advantage of these results, we define the variable $\eta ^{140-200}_{40-100}$ as the ratio of the median velocity dispersion in two specifically selected annuli and derive an analytical relation between $\eta ^{140-200}_{40-100}$ and the halo mass which can be directly applied to observations.

There are only three main classes of antifungal drugs currently used to treat aspergillosis, and antifungal resistance is increasing. Experimental results in fungal biology research are usually obtained as average measurements across whole populations while ignoring what is happening at the single cell level. In this study, we show that conidia with the same genetic background in the same cell population at a similar developmental stage show heterogeneity in their cell wall labeling at the single cell level. We present a rigorous statistical method, newly applied to quantify the level of cell heterogeneity, which allows for direct comparison of the heterogeneity observed between treatments. We show the extent of cell wall labeling heterogeneity in dormant conidia and how the level of heterogeneity changes during germination. The degree of heterogeneity is influenced by deletions of cell wall synthesizing genes and environmental conditions, including medium composition, method of inoculation, age of conidia, and the presence of antifungals. This heterogeneity results in subpopulations of germinating conidia with heterogeneous fitness to the antifungal caspofungin, which targets cell wall synthesis and heterogeneous sensitivity of dormant conidia to phagocytosis by macrophages.IMPORTANCE The fungus Aspergillus fumigatus can cause invasive lung diseases in immunocompromised patients resulting in high mortality. Treatment using antifungal compounds is often unsuccessful. Average population measurements hide what is happening at the individual cell level. We set out to test what impact individual differences between the cell walls of fungal conidia have on their behavior. We show that a population of cells having the same genetic background gives rise to subpopulations of cells that exhibit distinct behavior (phenotypic heterogeneity). This cell heterogeneity is dependent on the strain type, gene deletions, cell age, and environmental conditions. By looking at the individual cell level, we discovered subpopulations of cells that show differential fitness during antifungal treatment and uptake by immune cells.",False,0,,True,0

However, owing to the reliance on limited-duration solar power, the high power amplifier (HPA) is often driven close to its saturation point, which leads to severe nonlinear distortion in satellite channels. Thus, mitigating the effect of the nonlinear distortion becomes essential for reliable communications. In this article, we propose an efficient joint channel estimation and data detection method based on message passing within the associated factor graph modelling the HPA employed in nonlinear satellite channels. Then, we develop a combined belief propagation and mean field (BP-MF) method to cope with the hard constraints and dense short loops on the factor graph. In particular, the parametric message updating expressions relying on the canonical parameters are derived in the symbol detection part. To alleviate the impact of dense loops, we reformulate the system model into a compact form within the channel estimation part and then reconstruct a loop-free subgraph associated with vector-valued nodes to guarantee convergence. Furthermore, the proposed BP-MF method is also extended to the realistic scenario of having unknown noise variance. To further reduce the computational complexity of the large-scale matrix inversion of channel estimation, the generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm is employed to decouple the vector of channel coefficient estimation into a series of scalar estimations. Simulation results show that the proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art benchmarks both in terms of bit error rate performance and channel estimation accuracy.",False,0,,True,1

At the national level, the UK has set the ambitious target to reduce emissions by 78% by 2035, however, the UK is currently not on track to reach its 4 th and 5 th Carbon budgets, let alone the 6 th Carbon budget. Using a bottom-up emission reduction pathway based on local authority (LA) emissions reduction targets we find that the UK would achieve its 6 th Carbon Budget and its 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution if local emissions targets are achieved. More importantly, the targets set by local authorities could be missed by 39% in 2030 and 18% in 2037 and the UK as a whole would still be able to meet its climate targets. We discuss these results in the context of the current division of responsibilities between the national and local governments, the potential for, and consequences of, a gap emerging between the emissions of different local authorities, the capacity of local governments to meet net zero targets and the absence of regional government in the UK. We conclude that polycentric modes of climate governance, as are emerging from Climate Commissions developed in Leeds, Belfast, Edinburgh and 16 other local authorities across the UK, may play a key role helping to fill capacity gaps at the local and regional levels.",False,0,,True,0

This article analyses the different case in which the input thermal power is constant and the temperature difference across the TEG varies depending on its effective thermal resistance.

The profile crosses five ridge segments separated by a transform and three nontransform offsets. All ridge discontinuities share similar primary characteristics, independent of the offset. We identify two types of crustal segment. The first displays a classic two‐layer velocity structure with a high gradient Layer 2 (~0.9 s −1 ) above a lower gradient Layer 3 (0.2 s −1 ). Here, PmP coincides with the 7.5 km s −1 contour, and velocity increases to &gt;7.8 km s −1 within 1 km below. We interpret these segments as magmatically robust, with PmP representing a petrological boundary between crust and mantle. The second has a reduced contrast in velocity gradient between the upper and lower crust and PmP shallower than the 7.5 km s −1 contour. We interpret these segments as tectonically dominated, with PmP representing a serpentinized (alteration) front. While velocity‐depth profiles fit within previous envelopes for slow‐spreading crust, our results suggest that such generalizations give a misleading impression of uniformity. We estimate that the two crustal styles are present in equal proportions on the floor of the Atlantic. Within two tectonically dominated segments, we make the first wide‐angle seismic identifications of buried oceanic core complexes in mature (&gt;20 Ma) Atlantic Ocean crust. They have a ~20‐km‐wide “domal” morphology with shallow basement and increased upper crustal velocities.

Using a model star terpolymer system in an aqueous solution, a dissipative particle dynamic (DPD) simulation is employed to investigate how equilibrium aggregate structures are affected by polymer concentration and pairwise interaction energy in a solution. It is shown that a critical mass of polymer is necessary for vesicle formation. The free energy of the equilibrium aggregates are calculated and the results show that the transition from micelles to vesicles is governed by the interactions between the longest solvophobic block and the solvent. In addition, the ability of vesicles to encapsulate solvent is assessed. It is found that reducing the interaction energy favours solvent encapsulation, although solvent molecules can permeate through the vesicle's shell when repulsive interactions among monomers are low. Thus, one can optimize the loading capacity and the release rate of the vesicles by turning pairwise interaction energies of the polymer and the solvent.

However, there is only limited knowledge of how the product quality of ammonia recovered from real wastewater might impact on its downstream exploitation in fuel cells. This study therefore exploited vacuum stripping to produce an aqueous ammonia concentrate from real wastewater that was then evaluated within a direct ammonia fuel cell, as a reference technology for energy generation. A 17 g L−1 aqueous ammonia product was created by vacuum stripping centrate from a full-scale anaerobic digester (2 gN L−1). The pH of the product was lower than expected due to the mild-acidification of solution by the co-transport of low MW volatile organic compounds. This reduced power density in the fuel cell, due to the incomplete deprotonation of ammonia (lowering oxidation potential at the fuel cell anode) and a decrease in [OH–] which is required for complete electrochemical conversion. We propose that improved vacuum stripping design can increase the distillate ammonia concentration and produce a more alkaline product, yielding markedly higher fuel cell power density by enhancing ammonia oxidation at the anode (through concentration and deprotonation) and reducing [OH–] mass transfer limitations. As the separation energy for ammonia is dominated by the latent heat demand of water vapour, a synergy exists between creation of a concentrated ammonia product (that improves power density) and reducing the energy demand for separation. The energy balance from this research evidences that despite the high latent heat demand for separation, the low cost of heat coupled with the power produced from ammonia yield a favourable economic return when compared to conventional biological treatment. This study also identifies that revaluing ammonia as a carbon free fuel can help reposition wastewater treatment for a zero-carbon future.",False,0,,True,0

This is typically achieved through statistics that are complementary to the cosmic shear two-point correlation function, the most well established of which is the WL peak abundance. In this work, we study the clustering of WL peaks, and present parameter constraint forecasts for an lsst-like survey. We use the cosmo-SLICS wCDM simulations to measure the peak two-point correlation function for a range of cosmological parameters, and use the simulation data to train a Gaussian process regression emulator that is applied to generate likelihood contours and provide parameter constraint forecasts from mock observations. We investigate the dependence of the peak two-point correlation function on the peak height, and find that the clustering of low-amplitude peaks is complementary to that of high-amplitude peaks. Consequently, their combination gives significantly tighter constraints than the clustering of high peaks alone. The peak two-point correlation function is significantly more sensitive to the cosmological parameters h and w0 than the peak abundance, and when the probes are combined, constraints on Ωm, S8, h, and w0 improve by at least a factor of 2, relative to the peak abundance alone. Finally, we compare the forecasts for WL peaks and voids, and show that the two are also complementary; both probes can offer better constraints on S8 and w0 than the shear correlation function by roughly a factor of 2.",False,0,,True,0

We show that directional light sensing is possible because Synechocystis cells act as spherical microlenses, allowing the cell to see a light source and move towards it.

To identify broader changes in vitamin D metabolism during normal and PET pregnancies we developed a relatively simple but fully parametrised mathematical model of the vitamin D metabolic pathway. The data used for parametrisation were serum vitamin D metabolites analysed for a cross-sectional group of women (n = 88); including normal pregnant women at 1 st (NP1, n = 25) and 3rd trimester (NP3, n = 21) and pregnant women with PET (n = 22), as well as non-pregnant female controls (n = 20). To account for the effects various metabolites have upon each other, data were analysed using an ordinary differential equation model of the vitamin D reaction network. Information obtained from the model was then also applied to serum vitamin D metabolome data (n = 50) obtained from a 2nd trimester pregnancy cohort, of which 25 prospectively developed PET. Statistical analysis of the data alone showed no significant difference between NP3 and PET for serum 25(OH)D3 and 24,25(OH)2D3 concentrations. Conversely, a statistical analysis informed by the reaction network model revealed that a better indicator of PET is the ratios of vitamin D metabolites in late pregnancy. Assessing the potential predicative value, no significant difference between NP3 and PET cases at 15 weeks gestation was found. Mathematical modelling offers a novel strategy for defining the impact of vitamin D metabolism on human health. This is particularly relevant within the context of pregnancy, where major changes in vitamin D metabolism occur across gestation, and dysregulated metabolism is evidenced in women with established PET.",False,0,,True,0

Previously, we reported the effects of neat solvents on EA percutaneous absorption and observed that 0.6–7.5% of the applied EA was delivered through the skin over 24 h. In this work, we designed complex formulations using combinations of solvents that may act synergistically and examined their impact on EA permeation in porcine skin in vitro under finite dose conditions. Binary combinations of propylene glycol (PG) with propylene glycol monolaurate (PGML) were effective in enhancing skin permeation of EA compared with individual solvents (p &lt; 0.05). Combining PGML with 1,2-hexanediol (HEX) did not result in significantly higher EA permeation compared with the neat solvents (p &gt; 0.05). Addition of the volatile solvent isopropyl alcohol (IPA) to PG solutions also did not improve EA skin delivery compared with neat PG. Ternary solvent systems containing PG:PGML were subsequently prepared by the addition of a lipophilic solvent, either isopropyl myristate (IPM), medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) or isostearyl isostearate (ISIS). The optimum vehicle, PG:PGML:IPM, promoted up to 70.9% skin delivery of EA. The PG:PGML:ISIS vehicles also promoted EA permeation across the skin, but to a significantly lesser extent than the IPM-containing vehicles. No enhancement of EA delivery was noted for the PG:PGML:MCT mixtures. These results will inform the development of targeted formulations for EA in the future.",False,0,,True,0

Namely, by concatenating an [[ n , k , d ]] stabilizer outer code with dual-rail inner codes, we obtain a [[2 n , k , d ]] constant-excitation code immune from coherent phase errors and also equivalent to a Pauli-rotated stabilizer code. When the stabilizer outer code is fault-tolerant, the constant-excitation code has a positive fault-tolerant threshold against stochastic errors. Setting the outer code as a four-qubit amplitude damping code yields an eight-qubit constant-excitation code that corrects a single amplitude damping error, and we analyze this code’s potential as a quantum memory.",False,0,,True,0

STEM-ptychography uses a fast pixelated detector to collect a “4-dimensional” dataset consisting of a 2D electron diffraction pattern at every probe position of a 2D raster-scan. This 4D dataset can be used to recover the phase-image. Current camera technology, unfortunately, can only achieve a frame rate of a few thousand detector frames-per-second (fps), which means that the acquisition time of the 4D dataset is up to 1000× slower than the scanning speed in a conventional STEM, thereby limiting the potential applications of this method for dose-fragile and dynamic specimens. In this letter, we demonstrate that subsampling provides an effective method for optimizing ptychographic acquisition by reducing both the number of detector-pixels and the number of probe positions. Subsampling and recovery of the 4D dataset are shown using an experimental 4D dataset with randomly removed detector-pixels and probe positions. After compressive sensing recovery, Wigner distribution deconvolution is applied to obtain phase-images. Randomly sampling both the probe positions and the detector at 10% gives sufficient information for phase-retrieval and reduces acquisition time by 100×, thereby making STEM-ptychography competitive with conventional STEM.",False,0,,True,0

We employ state-of-the-art methods to yield a more detailed and nuanced picture of segregation in Shijiazhuang, a second-tier Chinese city. We use a multilevel modelling approach that allows us not only to quantify the extent of segregation at different spatial scales, but also to disentangle the intersectional nature of segregation: the extent to which segregation is due to migrant status or low income alone. We find that migrant status is actually more important than occupation in determining segregation.

It is unclear if the Siberian Arctic dog population was as continuous as the people of the region or if instead admixture occurred, possibly in relation to the influx of material culture from other parts of Eurasia. To address this question, we sequenced and analyzed the genomes of 20 ancient and historical Siberian and Eurasian Steppe dogs. Our analyses indicate that while Siberian dogs were genetically homogenous between 9,500 to 7,000 y ago, later introduction of dogs from the Eurasian Steppe and Europe led to substantial admixture. This is clearly the case in the Iamal-Nenets region (Northwestern Siberia) where dogs from the Iron Age period (∼2,000 y ago) possess substantially less ancestry related to European and Steppe dogs than dogs from the medieval period (∼1,000 y ago). Combined with findings of nonlocal materials recovered from these archaeological sites, including glass beads and metal items, these results indicate that Northwest Siberian communities were connected to a larger trade network through which they acquired genetically distinctive dogs from other regions.

Upon adsorption of chiral molecules, the spin–orbit coupling strength in Cu decreases and the Au films become ferromagnetic as evident from weak localization and antilocalization data. A theoretical model indicates that anisotropy in the molecular tilt angles, provided that the chiral molecules act as magnetic moments, induces a nonvanishing magnetic exchange interaction, causing changes in the spin–orbit coupling strength in Cu and Au.

These simulations are becoming increasingly challenging as the computational domain is customized to a patient's anatomy, within which large heterogeneous tension gradients are generated via biophysical cell models which drive simulations of the cardiac pump cycle. The convergence of nonlinear solvers in simulations of large deformation mechanics depends on many factors. When extreme stress or irregular deformations are modeled, commonly used numerical methods can often fail to find a solution, which can prevent investigation of interesting parameter variations or use of models in a clinical context with high standards for robustness. This paper outlines a novel numerical method that is straightforward to implement and which significantly improves the stability of these simulations. The method involves adding a compressibility penalty to the standard incompressible formulation of large deformation mechanics. We compare the method's performance when used with both a direct discretization of the equations for incompressible solid mechanics, as well as the formulation based on an isochoric/deviatoric split of the deformation gradient. The addition of this penalty decreases the tendency for solutions to deviate from the incompressibility constraint, and significantly improves the ability of the Newton solver to find a solution. Additionally, our method maintains the expected order of convergence under mesh refinement, has nearly identical solutions for the pressure-volume relations, and stabilizes the solver to allow challenging simulations of both diastolic and systolic function on personalized patient geometries.",False,0,,True,1

In this paper, we present an improved Breakout Local Search for VSP (named BLS-RLE). The distinguishing feature of this approach is a new parameter control mechanism that draws upon ideas from reinforcement learning theory to reach an interdependent decision on the number and on the type of perturbation moves. The mechanism complies with the principle of first carrying out intensification and then employing minimal diversification only if needed, it uses a dedicated sampling strategy for a rapid convergence towards a limited set of parameter values that appear to be the most convenient for the given state of search. Extensive experimental evaluations and statistical comparisons on a wide range of benchmark instances show significant improvement in performance of the proposed algorithm over the existing BLS algorithm for VSP. Indeed, out of the 422 tested instances, BLS-RLE was able to attain the best-known solution in 93.8% of the cases, which is around 20% higher compared to the existing BLS. In addition, we provide detailed analyses to evaluate the importance of the key elements of the proposed method and to justify the degree of diversification introduced during perturbation.",False,0,,True,0

Until now such measurements were hampered by the need for laborious, time-intensive alignment procedures. Here a different approach is demonstrated, using micro-beam Laue X-ray diffraction to first determine the lattice orientation of the micro-crystal. This information is then used to rapidly align coherent diffraction measurements of three or more reflections from the crystal. Based on these, 3D strain and stress fields in the crystal are successfully determined. This approach is demonstrated on a focused ion beam milled micro-crystal from which six reflections could be measured. Since information from more than three independent reflections is available, the reliability of the phases retrieved from the coherent diffraction data can be assessed. Our results show that rapid, reliable 3D coherent diffraction measurements of the full lattice strain tensor in specific micro-crystals are now feasible and can be successfully carried out even in heavily distorted samples.",False,0,,True,0

Accretion due to turbulent (""viscous"") transport of angular momentum results in a fundamentally different distribution of accretion rates than accretion driven by magnetised disc winds. We find that a homogeneous sample of $\gtrsim$300 observed accretion rates would be sufficient to distinguish between these two mechanisms of disc accretion at high confidence, even for pessimistic assumptions. Current samples of T Tauri star accretion rates are not this large, and also suffer from significant inhomogeneity, so both viscous and wind-driven models are broadly consistent with the existing observations. If accretion is viscous, the observed accretion rates require low rates of disc photoevaporation ($\lesssim$$10^{-9}$M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$). Uniform, homogeneous surveys of stellar accretion rates can therefore provide a clear answer to the long-standing question of how protoplanetary discs accrete.",False,0,,True,0

Stability of the first two solutions (those with largest minimum radius) is considered. We find that the first similarity solution, which is the one seen in experiments and simulations, is linearly stable with a complex nontrivial eigenvalue, which could explain the phenomenon of break-up producing sequences of small satellite droplets of decreasing radius near a main pinch-off point. The second solution is seen to be linearly unstable.

However, the relative importance of occasion characteristics is not yet well understood. This study aims to identify which characteristics, and combinations of characteristics, are associated with units consumed within drinking occasions. It also tests whether accounting for occasion characteristics improves the prediction of consumption compared to using demographic information only. Methods The data come from a cross‐sectional, nationally representative, online market research survey. Our sample includes 18,409 British drinkers aged 18 + who recorded the characteristics of 46,072 drinking occasions using 7‐day retrospective drinking diaries in 2018. We used decision tree modeling and nested linear regression to predict units consumed in occasions using information on drinking location/venue, occasion timing, company, occasion type (e.g., a quiet night in), occasion motivation, drink type and packaging, food eaten and entertainment/ other activities during the occasion. We estimated models separately for 6 age‐sex groups and controlled for usual drinking frequency, and social grade in nested linear regression models. Open Science Framework preregistration: https://osf.io/42epd . Results Our 6 final models accounted for between 55% and 71% of the variance in drinking occasion alcohol consumption. Beyond demographic characteristics (1 to 9%) and occasion duration (24 to 60%), further occasion characteristics and combinations of characteristics accounted for 31 to 70% of the total explained variance. The characteristics most strongly associated with heavy alcohol consumption were long occasion duration, drinking spirits as doubles, and drinking wine. Spirits were also consumed in light occasions, but as singles. This suggests that the serving size is an important differentiator of light and heavy occasions. Conclusions Combinations of occasion duration and drink type are strongly predictive of alcohol consumption in adults’ drinking occasions. Accounting for characteristics of drinking occasions, both individually and in combination, substantially improves the prediction of alcohol consumption.",False,0,,True,0

The bolometric light curve, the blackbody temperature and radius, the broad H and He i lambda 5876 emission lines and their evolution with time, are all consistent with a tidal disruption event (TDE) nature. A soft X-ray flare is detected with a delay of similar to 200 d with respect to the optical/UV peak and it is rapidly followed by the emergence of a broad He ii lambda 4686 and by a number of long-lasting high ionization coronal emission lines. This indicate a clear connection between a TDE flare and the appearance of extreme coronal line emission (ECLEs). An IR echo, resulting from dust re-radiation of the optical/UV TDE light is observed after the X-ray flare and the associated near-IR spectra show a transient broad feature in correspondence of the He i lambda 10830 and, for the first time in a TDE, a transient high-ionization coronal NIR line (the [Fe xiii] lambda 10798) is also detected. The data are well explained by a scenario in which a TDE occurs in a gas-and-dust rich environment and its optical/UV, soft X-ray, and IR emission have different origins and locations. The optical emission may be produced by stellar debris stream collisions prior to the accretion disc formation, which is instead responsible for the soft X-ray flare, emitted after the end of the circularization process.",False,0,,True,0

The optimization problems are challenging to solve due to their size, especially if the control problems include time‐varying uncertainty. This paper draws from local reduction methods used in semi‐infinite optimization to solve robust optimal control problems with parametric and time‐varying uncertainty. By iteratively adding interim worst‐case scenarios to the problem, methods based on local reduction provide a way to manage the total number of scenarios. We show that the local reduction method for optimal control problems consists of solving a series of simplified optimal control problems to find worst‐case constraint violations. In particular, we present examples where local reduction methods find worst‐case scenarios that are not on the boundary of the uncertainty set. We also provide bounds on the error if local solvers are used. The proposed approach is illustrated with two case studies with parametric and additive time‐varying uncertainty. In the first case study, the number of scenarios obtained from local reduction is 101, smaller than in the case when all extreme scenarios are considered. In the second case study, the number of scenarios obtained from the local reduction is two compared to 512 extreme scenarios. Our approach was able to satisfy the constraints both for parametric uncertainty and time‐varying disturbances, whereas approaches from literature either violated the constraints or became computationally expensive.",False,0,,True,0

We propose and analyse a model with positive feedback between recruitment of myosin motors and mechanical tension in cell junctions. The model produces active T1 events, which act to elongate the tissue perpendicular to the main direction of tissue stress. Using an idealised tissue patch comprising several active cells embedded in a matrix of passive hexagonal cells, we identified an optimal range of mechanical stresses to trigger an active T1 event. We show that directed stresses also generate tension chains in a realistic patch made entirely of active cells of random shapes and leads to convergence–extension over a range of parameters. Our findings show that active intercalations can generate stress that activates T1 events in neighbouring cells, resulting in tension-dependent tissue reorganisation, in qualitative agreement with experiments on gastrulation in chick embryos.",False,0,,True,0

In coiled coils, two or more α helices wrapped around each other to form bundles. This apparently simple structural motif can generate many architectures and topologies. Understanding the variety of and limits on coiled-coil assemblies and their sequence-to-structure relationships impacts on protein structure, design, and engineering. Coiled coil-forming sequences can be predicted from heptad repeats of hydrophobic and polar residues, hpphppp , although this is not always reliable. Alternatively, coiled-coil structures can be identified using the program SOCKET, which finds knobs-into-holes (KIH) packing between side chains of neighboring helices. SOCKET also classifies coiled-coil architecture and topology, thus allowing sequence-to-structure relationships to be garnered. In 2009, we used SOCKET to create a relational database of coiled-coil structures, CC + , from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB). Here we report an update of CC + following the recent explosion of structural data and the success of AlphaFold2 in predicting protein structures from genome sequences. With the most-stringent SOCKET parameters, CC + contains ≈12,000 coiled-coil assemblies from experimentally determined structures, and ≈120,000 potential coiled-coil structures within single-chain models predicted by AlphaFold2 across 48 proteomes. CC + allows these and other less-stringently defined coiled coils to be searched at various levels of structure, sequence, and side-chain interactions. The identified coiled coils can be viewed directly from CC + using the Socket2 application, and their associated data can be downloaded for further analyses. CC + is available freely at http://coiledcoils.chm.bris.ac.uk/CCPlus/Home.html . It will be regularly updated automatically. FOR THE BROADER AUDIENCE Protein assemblies and protein-protein interactions are key to all biological processes. α-Helical coiled coils are one of the most common modes of directing and stabilising these interfaces. Here, we report an updated CC + database of structurally validated coiled coils from experimental protein structures and AlphaFold2 models. CC + contains many thousands of coiled-coil structures and models, associated parameters, and sequences.

Noise-induced cochlear synaptopathy usually leaves cochlear thresholds unaltered, but is associated with long-term reductions in auditory brainstem response (ABR) amplitudes at medium-to-high sound levels. This pathophysiology has been suggested to degrade speech perception in noise (SPiN), perhaps explaining why SPiN ability varies so widely among audiometrically normal humans. The present study is the first to test for evidence of cochlear synaptopathy in humans with significant SPiN impairment. Individuals were recruited on the basis of self-reported SPiN difficulties and normal pure tone audiometric thresholds. Performance on a listening task identified a subset with ""verified"" SPiN impairment. This group was matched with controls on the basis of age, sex, and audiometric thresholds up to 14 kHz. ABRs and envelope-following responses (EFRs) were recorded at high stimulus levels, yielding both raw amplitude measures and within-subject difference measures. Past exposure to high sound levels was assessed by detailed structured interview. Impaired SPiN was not associated with greater lifetime noise exposure, nor with any electrophysiological measure. It is conceivable that retrospective self-report cannot reliably capture noise exposure, and that ABRs and EFRs offer limited sensitivity to synaptopathy in humans. Nevertheless, the results do not support the notion that noise-induced synaptopathy is a significant etiology of SPiN impairment with normal audiometric thresholds. It may be that synaptopathy alone does not have significant perceptual consequences, or is not widespread in humans with normal audiograms.",False,0,,True,0

A promising algorithm, known as guided policy search (GPS), is capable of handling the challenge of training samples using trajectory-centric methods. It can also provide asymptotic local convergence guarantees. However, in its current form, the GPS algorithm cannot operate in sequential multitask learning scenarios. This is due to its batch-style training requirement, where all training samples are collectively provided at the start of the learning process. The algorithm's adaptation is thus hindered for real-time applications, where training samples or tasks can arrive randomly. In this paper, the GPS approach is reformulated, by adapting a recently proposed, lifelong-learning method, and elastic weight consolidation. Specifically, Fisher information is incorporated to impart knowledge from previously learned tasks. The proposed algorithm, termed sequential multitask learning-GPS, is able to operate in sequential multitask learning settings and ensuring continuous policy learning, without catastrophic forgetting. Pendulum and robotic manipulation experiments demonstrate the new algorithms efficacy to learn control policies for handling sequentially arriving training samples, delivering comparable performance to the traditional, and batch-based GPS algorithm. In conclusion, the proposed algorithm is posited as a new benchmark for the real-time RL and robotics research community.",False,0,,True,1

A shared feature of these viruses is the ability to exchange genome segments during coinfection of a host by a process termed ""reassortment."" Reassortment enables rapid evolutionary change, but where transmission involves a biological arthropod vector, this change is constrained by the selection pressures imposed by the requirement for replication in two evolutionarily distant hosts. In this study, we use an in vivo, host-arbovirus-vector model to investigate the impact of reassortment on two phenotypic traits, virus infection rate in the vector and virulence in the host. Bluetongue virus (BTV) (Reoviridae) is the causative agent of bluetongue (BT), an economically important disease of domestic and wild ruminants and deer. The genome of BTV comprises 10 linear segments of dsRNA, and the virus is transmitted between ruminants by Culicoides biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae). Five strains of BTV representing three serotypes (BTV-1, BTV-4, and BTV-8) were isolated from naturally infected ruminants in Europe and ancestral/reassortant lineage status assigned through full genome sequencing. Each strain was then assessed in parallel for the ability to replicate in vector Culicoides and to cause BT in sheep. Our results demonstrate that two reassortment strains, which themselves became established in the field, had obtained high replication ability in C. sonorensis from one of the ancestral virus strains, which allowed inferences of the genome segments conferring this phenotypic trait. IMPORTANCE Reassortment between virus strains can lead to major shifts in the transmission parameters and virulence of segmented RNA viruses, with consequences for spread, persistence, and impact. The ability of these pathogens to adapt rapidly to their environment through this mechanism presents a major challenge in defining the conditions under which emergence can occur. Utilizing a representative mammalian host-insect vector infection and transmission model, we provide direct evidence of this phenomenon in closely related ancestral and reassortant strains of BTV. Our results demonstrate that efficient infection of Culicoides observed for one of three ancestral BTV strains was also evident in two reassortant strains that had subsequently emerged in the same ecosystem.",False,0,,True,0

The proteins within this family target different transcripts in different tissues. In particular, ZFP36 targets myogenic transcripts and may have a role in adult muscle stem cell quiescence. Our study examined the requirement of ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 in adult muscle cell fate regulation. We generated single and double conditional knockout mice in which Zfp36l1 and/or Zfp36l2 were deleted in Pax7-expressing cells. Immunostained muscle sections were used to analyse resting skeletal muscle, and a cardiotoxin-induced injury model was used to determine the regenerative capacity of muscle. We show that ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 proteins are expressed in satellite cells. Mice lacking the two proteins in Pax7-expressing cells have reduced body weight and have reduced skeletal muscle mass. Furthermore, the number of satellite cells is reduced in adult skeletal muscle and the capacity of this muscle to regenerate following muscle injury is diminished. ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 act redundantly in myogenesis. These findings add further intricacy to the regulation of the cell fate of Pax7-expressing cells in skeletal muscle by RNA-binding proteins.",False,0,,True,0

Accordingly, it is timely to assess critically some of the assumptions of traditional semi-analytic galaxy formation models. We use the eagle simulations to assess assumptions built into the galform semi-analytic model, focusing on those relating to baryon cycling, angular momentum and feedback. We show that the assumption in galform that newly formed stars have the same specific angular momentum as the total disc leads to a significant overestimate of the total stellar specific angular momentum of disc galaxies. In eagle, stars form preferentially out of low-specific angular momentum gas in the interstellar medium due to the assumed gas density threshold for stars to form, leading to more realistic galaxy sizes. We find that stellar mass assembly is similar between galform and eagle but that the evolution of gas properties is different, with various indications that the rate of baryon cycling in eagle is slower than is assumed in galform. Finally, by matching individual galaxies between eagle and galform, we find that an artificial dependence of active galactic nucleus feedback and gas infall rates on halo mass-doubling events in galform drives most of the scatter in stellar mass between individual objects. Put together our results suggest that the galform semi-analytic model can be significantly improved in light of recent advances.",False,0,,True,1

Results:In order to study the relationship between interface composition and binding specificity, we make use of paralogous pairs of yeast proteins.Immediately after duplication these paralogues will have identical sequences and protein products that make an identical set of interactions.As the sequences diverge, we can correlate amino-acid change in the interface with any change in the specificity of binding.We show that change in interface regions correlates only weakly with change in specificity, and many variants in interfaces are functionally equivalent.We show that many of the residue replacements within interfaces are silent with respect to their contribution to binding specificity. Conclusions:We conclude that such functionally-equivalent change has the potential to contribute to evolutionary plasticity in interfaces by creating cryptic variation, which in turn may provide the raw material for functional innovation and coevolution.",False,0,,True,0

They target eukaryotic cells using different mechanisms, but all require the presence of cholesterol to pierce lipid bilayers. How CDCs use cholesterol to selectively lyse cells is essential for understanding virulence strategies of several pathogenic bacteria, and for repurposing CDCs to kill new cellular targets. Here we address that question by trapping an early state of pore formation for the CDC intermedilysin, bound to the human immune receptor CD59 in a nanodisc model membrane. Our cryo electron microscopy map reveals structural transitions required for oligomerization, which include the lateral movement of a key amphipathic helix. We demonstrate that the charge of this helix is crucial for tuning lytic activity of CDCs. Furthermore, we discover modifications that overcome the requirement of cholesterol for membrane rupture, which may facilitate engineering the target-cell specificity of pore-forming proteins.",False,0,,True,0

The primary pathway for nonradiative recombination in organic donor-acceptor heterojunction devices is believed to be the decay of a charge-transfer (CT) excited state to the ground state via energy transfer to vibrational modes. Recently, nonradiative voltage losses have been related to properties of the charge-transfer state such as the Franck-Condon factor describing the overlap of the CT and ground-state vibrational states and, therefore, to the energy of the CT state. However, experimental data do not always follow the trends suggested by the simple model. Here, we extend this recombination model to include other factors that influence the nonradiative decay-rate constant, and therefore the open-circuit voltage, but have not yet been explored in detail. We use the extended model to understand the observed behavior of series of small molecules:fullerene blend devices, where open-circuit voltage appears insensitive to nonradiative loss. The trend could be explained only in terms of a microstructure-dependent CT-state oscillator strength, showing that parameters other than CT-state energy can control nonradiative recombination. We present design rules for improving open-circuit voltage via the control of material parameters and propose a realistic limit to the power-conversion efficiency of organic solar cells.Received 11 May 2018Revised 20 July 2018Corrected 15 April 2020DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.8.031055Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

They have been extensively studied in a transgenic line in which enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) is expressed under control of the Grp gene. The GRP-eGFP cells are separate from several other neurochemically-defined excitatory interneuron populations, and correspond to a class previously defined as transient central cells. However, mRNA for GRP is widely distributed among excitatory interneurons in superficial dorsal horn. Here we show that although Grp mRNA is present in several transcriptomically-defined populations, eGFP is restricted to a discrete subset of cells in the GRP::eGFP mouse, some of which express the neuromedin receptor 2 and likely belong to a cluster defined as Glut8. We show that these cells receive much of their excitatory synaptic input from MrgA3/MrgD-expressing nociceptive/pruritoceptive afferents and C-low threshold mechanoreceptors. Although the cells were not innervated by pruritoceptors expressing brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) most of them contained mRNA for NPR1, the receptor for BNP. In contrast, these cells received only ~ 10% of their excitatory input from other interneurons. These findings demonstrate that the GRP-eGFP cells constitute a discrete population of excitatory interneurons with a characteristic pattern of synaptic input.",False,0,,True,0

These receptors are the most targeted nAChRs in drug discovery programmes for brain disorders. However, the development of subtype-specific agonists remains challenging due to the high degree of sequence homology and conservation of function in nAChRs. We have developed C(10) variants of cytisine, a partial agonist of α4β2 nAChR that has been used for smoking cessation. The C(10) methyl analogue used in this study displays negligible affinity for α7 nAChR, while retaining high affinity for α4β2 nAChR.The structural underpinning of the selectivity of 10-methylcytisine for α7 and α4β2 nAChRs was investigated using molecular dynamic simulations, mutagenesis and whole-cell and single-channel current recordings.We identified a conserved arginine in the β3 strand that exhibits a non-conserved function in nAChRs. In α4β2 nAChR, the arginine forms a salt bridge with an aspartate residue in loop B that is necessary for receptor expression, whereas in α7 nAChR, this residue is not stabilised by electrostatic interactions, making its side chain highly mobile. This lack of constrain produces steric clashes with agonists and affects the dynamics of residues involved in agonist binding and the coupling network.We conclude that the high mobility of the β3-strand arginine in the α7 nAChR influences agonist binding and possibly gating network and desensitisation. The findings have implications for rational design of subtype-selective nAChR agents.",False,0,,True,0

In Uganda alone, approximately 11.6 million people are affected. Despite over a decade of mass drug administration in this country, hyper-endemic hotspots persist, and individuals who are repeatedly heavily and rapidly reinfected are observed. Human blood-type antigens are known to play a role in the risk of infection for a variety of diseases, due to cross-reactivity between host antibodies and pathogenic antigens. There have been conflicting results on the effect of blood type on schistosomiasis infection and pathology. Moreover, the effect of blood type as a potential intrinsic host factor on S. mansoni prevalence, intensity, clearance, and reinfection dynamics and on co-infection risk remains unknown. Therefore, the epidemiological link between host blood type and S. mansoni infection dynamics was assessed in three hyper-endemic communities in Uganda. Longitudinal data incorporating repeated pretreatment S. mansoni infection intensities and clearance rates were used to analyse associations between blood groups in school-aged children. Soil-transmitted helminth coinfection status and biometric parameters were incorporated in a generalised linear mixed regression model including age, gender, and body mass index (BMI), which have previously been established as significant factors influencing the prevalence and intensity of schistosomiasis. The analysis revealed no associations between blood type and S. mansoni prevalence, infection intensity, clearance, reinfection, or coinfection. Variations in infection profiles were significantly different between the villages, and egg burden significantly decreased with age. While blood type has proven to be a predictor of several diseases, the data collected in this study indicate that it does not play a significant role in S. mansoni infection burdens in these high-endemicity communities.",False,0,,True,0

The evolution mechanisms of surface roughness during LPBF are not well understood due to a lack of in situ characterisation methods. Here, we quantified key processes and defect dynamics using synchrotron X-ray imaging and ex situ optical imaging and explained the evolution mechanisms of side-skin and top-skin roughness during multi-layer LPBF of Ti-6AI-4V (where down-skin roughness was out of the project scope). We found that the average surface roughness alone is not an accurate representation of surface topology of an LPBF component and that the surface topology is multimodal (e.g., containing both roughness and waviness) and multiscale (e.g., from 25 µm sintered powder features to 250 µm molten pool wavelength). Both roughness and topology are significantly affected by the formation of pre-layer humping, spatter, and rippling defects. We developed a surface topology matrix that accurately describes surface features by combining 8 different metrics: average roughness, root mean square roughness, maximum profile peak height, maximum profile valley height, mean height, mean width, skewness, and melt pool size ratio. This matrix provides a guide to determine the appropriate linear energy density to achieve the optimum surface finish of Ti-6AI-4V thin-wall builds.

Complex domain patterns are generated during the main yield event, which leads to large displacements of surface atoms and emission of acoustic waves. Loading beyond the yield point leads, eventually, to a simplification of the domain patterns by local movements of needle domains, the nucleation and movement of kinks in domain walls, and the collapse of domains spanning the entire sample (from surface to surface). These microstructural changes lead to much weaker acoustic emissions than those near the yield point. Nucleation/collapse during a yield event involves an energy drop of some 3.7 meV/atom; the collapse of spanning domains releases 0.56 meV/atom, a kink crashing into the surface changes the energy by 0.017 meV/atom, and the collapsing vertical needle changes the energy by 0.017 meV/atom. All these energy bursts can, in principle, be seen by AE. The large energy spread means that AE spectroscopy measures a mixture of events whereby weak and strong signals may signify smaller and bigger events of the same kind or different microstructural changes with intrinsically different signal strengths. In order to disentangle the various contributions, other observables are needed, such as the time-dependent strain matrix of the deformed sample.",False,0,,True,0

It uses third-order piecewise polynomials for the representation of a field and piecewise third-degree polynomials for fluxes. For the discretization, SEM3 uses the irregular Legendre–Gauss–Lobatto grid while o3o3 uses a regular collocation grid. o3o3 can be regarded as an inhomogeneous finite-difference scheme on a uniform grid, which means that the finite-difference equations are different for each group with three points. A particular version of o3o3 is set as an example of many possibilities to construct LGM schemes on piecewise polynomial spaces in which the basis functions used are continuous at corner points and function spaces having continuous derivatives are shortly discussed. We propose a standard o3o3 scheme and a spectral o3o3 scheme as alternatives to the standard method of using the quadrature approximation. These two particular schemes selected were chosen for ease of implementation rather than optimal performance. In one dimension, compared to standard SEM3, o3o3 has a larger CFL condition benefiting from the use of a regular collocation grid. While SEM3 uses the irregular Legendre–Gauss–Lobatto collocation grid, o3o3 uses a regular grid. This is considered an advantage for physical parameterizations. The shortest resolved wave is marginally smaller than that with SEM3. In two dimensions, o3o3 is implemented on a sparse grid where only a part of the points on the underlying regular grid are used for forecasting.",False,0,,True,0

The economy is populated by high-skilled and low-skilled households and household tasks are performed by own work, machines, or servants. For the period 1900-1960, innovations in household automation motivate the decline of the servant economy and the creation of new household tasks motivates an almost constant division of household time between wage work and domestic work. For the period 1960-2020, innovations in firm automation and the implied increase of the skill premium explain the return of the servant economy. We show the robustness of results to the introduction of time trends in skilled-labor supply and the consideration of endogenous demand for leisure. With counterfactual experiments we address the effects of task-dependent disutility of work and of innovations in servant efficiency (the Gig economy).

As we cannot directly track the phase alignment between theta activity and inner speech over time, we used EEG to measure the brain's phase-locked responses to the onset of speech quote reading. We found that direct (vs. indirect) quote reading was associated with increased theta phase synchrony over trials at 250–500 ms post-reading onset, with sources of the evoked activity estimated in the speech processing network. An eye-tracking control experiment confirmed that increased theta phase synchrony in direct quote reading was not driven by eye movement patterns, and more likely reflects synchronous phase resetting at the onset of inner speech.

Copper is also known to interact with the negatively charged lipid, phosphatidylserine (PS), as well as α-synuclein, an aggregation-prone protein enriched in the synapse, which plays a role in synaptic vesicle docking and fusion. However, the interplay between copper, PS lipid, and α-synuclein is not known. Herein, we report a detailed and predominantly kinetic study of the interactions among these three components pertinent to copper homeostasis and neurotransmission. We found that synaptic vesicle-mimicking small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) can sequester any excess free Cu2+ within milliseconds, and bound Cu2+ on SUVs can be reduced to Cu+ by GSH at a nearly constant rate under physiological conditions. Moreover, we revealed that SUV-bound Cu2+ does not affect the binding between wild-type α-synuclein and SUVs but affect that between N-terminal acetylated α-synuclein and SUVs. In contrast, Cu2+ can effectively displace both types of α-synuclein from the vesicles. Our results suggest that synaptic vesicles may mediate copper transfer in the brain, while copper could participate in synaptic vesicle docking to the plasma membrane via its regulation of the interaction between α-synuclein and synaptic vesicle.",False,0,,True,0

Recently a number of NP-based diagnostic and therapeutic agents have been developed for treatment of various diseases, where judicious surface functionalization is exploited to increase efficacy of administered therapeutic dose. However, quantification of heterogeneity associated with absolute dose of a nanotherapeutic (NP number), how this is trafficked across biological barriers has proven difficult to achieve. The main issue being the quantitative assessment of NP number at the spatial scale of the individual NP, data which is essential for the continued growth and development of the next generation of nanotherapeutics. Recent advances in sample preparation and the imaging fidelity of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) platforms provide information at the required spatial scale, where individual NPs can be individually identified. High spatial resolution however reduces the sample frequency and as a result dynamic biological features or processes become opaque. However, the combination of TEM data with appropriate probabilistic models provide a means to extract biophysical information that imaging alone cannot. Previously, we demonstrated that limited cell sampling via TEM can be statistically coupled to large population flow cytometry measurements to quantify exact NP dose. Here we extended this concept to link TEM measurements of NP agglomerates in cell culture media to that encapsulated within vesicles in human osteosarcoma cells. By construction and validation of a data-driven transfer function, we are able to investigate the dynamic properties of NP agglomeration through endocytosis. In particular, we statistically predict how NP agglomerates may traverse a biological barrier, detailing inter-agglomerate merging events providing the basis for predictive modelling of nanopharmacology.",False,0,,True,0

This paper contributes to efforts to delineate this emerging domain by presenting a newly constructed bibliometric definition of synthetic biology. Our approach is dimensioned from a core set of papers in synthetic biology, using procedures to obtain benchmark synthetic biology publication records, extract keywords from these benchmark records, and refine the keywords, supplemented with articles published in dedicated synthetic biology journals. We compare our search strategy with other recent bibliometric approaches to define synthetic biology, using a common source of publication data for the period from 2000 to 2015. The paper details the rapid growth and international spread of research in synthetic biology in recent years, demonstrates that diverse research disciplines are contributing to the multidisciplinary development of synthetic biology research, and visualizes this by profiling synthetic biology research on the map of science. We further show the roles of a relatively concentrated set of research sponsors in funding the growth and trajectories of synthetic biology.

Here we model submarine melt‐driven undercutting of tidewater glacier termini, simulating a process which is key to understanding ice‐ocean coupling. Where runoff emerges from broad subglacial channels we find that undercutting has only a weak impact on local submarine melt rate but increases total ablation by submarine melting due to the larger submerged ice surface area. Thus, the impact of melting is determined not only by the melt rate magnitude but also by the slope of the ice‐ocean interface. We suggest that the most severe undercutting occurs at the maximum height in the fjord reached by the plume, likely promoting calving of ice above. It remains unclear, however, whether undercutting proceeds sufficiently rapidly to influence calving at Greenland's fastest‐flowing glaciers.",False,0,,True,0

We find that the momenta and spatial derivatives from gravity and matter fields must combine in a very specific form to maintain a deformed general covariance. This suggests that the deformation should be equally caused by matter field derivatives as it is by gravitational curvature.

This is driving the emergence of colistin resistance in multidrug-resistant strains that underlie life-threatening infections. This study analyses the mutational diversity of 22 genes associated with colistin resistance in 140 K. pneumoniae clinical isolates integrated in a high-resolution phylogenetic scenario. Colistin susceptibility was accessed by broth microdilution. A total of 98 isolates were susceptible and 16 were resistant, 10 of which were carbapenemase producers. Across the 22 genes examined, 171 non-synonymous mutations and 9 mutations associated with promoter regions were found. Eighty-five isolates had a truncation and/or deletion in at least one of the 22 genes. However, only seven mutations, the complete deletion of mgrB or insertion sequence (IS)-mediated disruption, were exclusively observed in resistant isolates. Four of these (mgrBIle13fs, pmrBGly207Asp, phoQHis339Asp and ramAIle28Met) comprised novel mutations that are potentially involved in colistin resistance. One strain bore a ISEcp1-blaCTX-M-15::mgrB disruption, underlying co-resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and colistin. Moreover, the high-resolution phylogenetic context shows that most of the mutational diversity spans multiple phylogenetic clades, and most of the mutations previously associated with colistin resistance are clade-associated and present in susceptible isolates, showing no correlation with colistin resistance. In conclusion, the present study provides relevant data on the genetic background of genes involved with colistin resistance deeply rooted across monophyletic groups and provides a better understanding of the genes and mutations involved in colistin resistance.",False,0,,True,0

Most of the ∼3000 proteins in chloroplasts are nucleus encoded and must be imported from the cytosol. Thus, the protein import machinery of the organelle (the TOC-TIC apparatus) is of fundamental importance for chloroplast biogenesis and operation. Cytosolic factors target chloroplast precursor proteins to the TOC-TIC apparatus, which drives protein import across the envelope membranes into the organelle, before various internal systems mediate downstream routing to different suborganellar compartments. The protein import system is proteolytically regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), enabling centralized control over the organellar proteome. In addition, the UPS targets a range of chloroplast proteins directly. In this Cell Science at a Glance article and the accompanying poster, we present mechanistic details of these different chloroplast protein targeting and translocation events, and of the UPS systems that regulate chloroplast proteins.",False,0,,True,0

Fluids 35, 035107 (2023)] for the decomposition of the skin-friction coefficient to integrate the mean temperature equation for high-Reynolds-number compressible boundary layers and arrive at an identity for the decomposition of the wall-heat flux. The physical interpretation of the identity and the limitations of this approach are discussed. We perform an integration on the mean temperature equation to obtain an identity that is the heat-transfer analog to the compressible von Kármán momentum integral equation for the skin-friction coefficient. This identity is applied to numerical data for laminar and turbulent compressible boundary layers, revealing that the mean-flow dissipation and production of turbulent kinetic energy given by the Favre–Reynolds stresses dominate the thermal-energy balance. The term related to the growth of the turbulent boundary layer opposes the wall cooling. Other identities for the wall-heat flux, inspired by the method of Fukagata et al. [“Contribution of Reynolds stress distribution to the skin friction in wall-bounded flows,” Phys. Fluids 14(11), L73–L76 (2002)], are studied numerically and by asymptotic methods. The terms of these identities depend spuriously on the upper integration bound because this bound is a mathematical quantity used in the derivation. When the bound is asymptotically large, the integral identities simplify to the heat-transfer analog to the von Kármán momentum equation. We also prove that an existing multiple-integration identity reduces to the definition of the wall-heat flux when the number of integrations is asymptotically large. No information about the wall-heat transfer is extracted because the impact of the integration number is nonphysical.",False,0,,True,0

However, there is a dearth of well-conducted natural experimental studies examining the causal effect of changing urban green space on physical activity and wellbeing. This is especially true in older adults and in the United Kingdom. This paper describes a natural experimental study to evaluate the effect of four small-scale urban street greening interventions on older adults' physical activity and wellbeing over a 1-year period, relative to eight matched comparison sites. All sites are located in deprived urban neighbourhoods in Greater Manchester, United Kingdom. Components of the interventions include tree and flower planting, and artificial tree decorations. Eight unimproved comparison sites were selected based on a systematic process of matching using several known objective and subjective environmental correlates of physical activity in older adults. The outcome measures are physical activity and two other behavioural indicators of wellbeing (Connect: connecting with other people; and Take Notice: taking notice of the environment), collected using a newly developed observation tool. The primary outcome is Take Notice behaviour due to largest effects on this behaviour being anticipated from improvements in the aesthetic quality of green space at the intervention sites. Baseline data collection occurred in September 2017 before the interventions were installed in November 2017. Follow-up data collection will be repeated in February/ March 2018 (6 months) and September 2018 (12 months). The present study permits a rare opportunity to evaluate the causal effects of small-scale changes in urban green space in an understudied population and setting. Although the interventions are expected to have small effects on the outcomes, the present study contributes to developing natural experiment methodology in this field by addressing key methodological weaknesses causing high risk of bias in previous natural experimental studies. Key improvements to reduce risk of bias in the present study are rigorous matching of multiple comparison sites and appropriate statistical control of key confounders.

Large separation of scales and large anomalous dimensions are frequently desired by phenomenological models. Mass-split systems are well-suited for composite Higgs models because they are governed by a conformal fixed point in the ultraviolet but are chirally broken in the infrared. In this work we use lattice field theory calculations with domain wall fermions to investigate a system with four light and six heavy flavors. We demonstrate how a nearby conformal fixed point affects the properties of the four light flavors that exhibit chiral symmetry breaking in the infrared. Specifically we describe hyperscaling of dimensionful physical quantities and determine the corresponding anomalous mass dimension. We obtain $y_m=1+\gamma^*= 1.47(5)$ suggesting that $N_f=10$ lies inside the conformal window. Comparing the low energy spectrum to predictions of dilaton chiral perturbation theory, we observe excellent agreement which supports the expectation that the 4+6 mass-split system exhibits near-conformal dynamics with a relatively light $0^{++}$ isosinglet scalar.",False,0,,True,0

Since resilience is a multidisciplinary term, it is important to review what has been achieved in the wastewater sector, and describe the future research directions for the forthcoming years. This work presents a critical review of studies that deal with resilience in the wastewater treatment sector, with a special focus on understanding how they addressed the key elements for assessing resilience, such as stressors, system properties, metrics and interventions to increase resilience. The results showed that only 17 peer-reviewed papers and 6 relevant reports, a small subset of the work in wastewater research, directly addressed resilience. The lack of consensus in the definition of resilience, and the elements of a resilience assessment, is hindering the implementation of resilience in wastewater management. To date, no framework for resilience assessment is complete, comprehensive or directly applicable to practitioners; current examples are lacking key elements (e.g. a comprehensive study of stressors, properties and metrics, examples of cases study, ability to benchmark interventions or connectivity with broader frameworks). Furthermore, resilience is seen as an additional cost or extra effort, instead of a means to overcome project uncertainty that could unlock new opportunities for investment.",False,0,,True,0

The feedback gains that deliver the required pole placement with minimum effort may then be determined using standard procedures.

We then report on several comparisons of metaphor use among texts and genres that stand in source–target relationships within this web of intralingual translations, and also consider the metaphors used by students themselves to express their understanding of climate change.

An improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying these symptoms is urgently required to facilitate the development of symptomatic or preventative therapies. In this study, we have used skin-saphenous nerve recordings in vitro and behavioral experiments in mice to characterize the direct effects of oxaliplatin on different types of sensory afferent fibers. Our results confirmed that mice injected with oxaliplatin rapidly develop mechanical and cold hypersensitivities. We further noted profound changes to A fiber activity after the application of oxaliplatin to the receptive fields in the skin. Most oxaliplatin-treated Aδ- and rapidly adapting Aβ-units lost mechanical sensitivity, but units that retained responsiveness additionally displayed a novel, aberrant cold sensitivity. Slowly adapting Aβ-units did not display mechanical tachyphylaxis, and a subset of these fibers was sensitized to mechanical and cold stimulation after oxaliplatin treatment. C fiber afferents were less affected by acute applications of oxaliplatin, but a subset gained cold sensitivity. Taken together, our findings suggest that direct effects on peripheral A fibers play a dominant role in the development of acute oxaliplatin-induced cold hypersensitivity, numbness, and dysesthesia. PERSPECTIVE: The chemotherapeutic drug oxaliplatin rapidly gives rise to dose-limiting cold pain and dysesthesia. Here, we have used behavioral and electrophysiological studies of mice to characterize the responsible neurons. We show that oxaliplatin directly confers aberrant cold responsiveness to subsets of A-fibers while silencing other fibers of the same type.",False,0,,True,1

We explore the formation and evolution of dust rings - now commonly observed in protoplanetary discs by ALMA - in the presence of relatively low mass (12-60 Earth masses) migrating planets. Through two dimensional hydrodynamical simulations using gas and dust we find that the importance of perturbations in the pressure profile interior and exterior to the planet varies for different particle sizes. For small sizes a dust enhancement occurs interior to the planet, whereas it is exterior to it for large particles. The transition between these two behaviours happens when the dust drift velocity is comparable to the planet migration velocity.

Prior work suggests that semantic icons entice and immerse the reader; however, little is known about their impact with informational tasks and when the viewer's attention is divided because of a distracting element. To address this gap, we first explored a variety of semantic icons with various visualisation attributes. The findings of this exploration shaped the design of our primary comparative online user studies, where participants saw a target visualisation with a distracting visualisation on a web page and were asked to extract insights. Their engagement was measured through three dependent variables: (1) visual attention, (2) effort to write insights, and (3) self-reported engagement. In Study 1, we discovered that visualisations with semantic icons were consistently perceived to be more engaging than the plain version. However, we found no differences in visual attention and effort between the two versions. Thus, we ran Study 2 using visualisations with more salient semantic icons to achieve maximum contrast. The results were consistent with our first Study. Furthermore, we found that semantic icons elevated engagement with visualisations depicting less interesting and engaging topics from the participant's perspective. We extended prior work by demonstrating the semantic value after performing an informational task (extracting insights) and reflecting on the visualisation, besides its value to the first impression. Our findings may be helpful to visualisation designers and storytellers keen on designing engaging visualisations with limited resources. We also contribute reflections on engagement measurements with visualisations and provide future directions.",False,0,,True,0

However, in real life problems, images may be affected by the imaging environment, such as varying illumination and noise during the process of imaging acquisition. This may lead to the local intensity distortion, which makes it meaningless to minimize the intensity difference in the traditional registration framework. To address this problem, we propose a variational model for joint image registration and intensity correction. Based on this model, a related greedy matching problem is solved by introducing a multiscale approach for joint image registration and intensity correction. An alternating direction method (ADM) is proposed to solve each multiscale step, and the convergence of the ADM method is proved. For the numerical implementation, a coarse-to-fine strategy is further proposed to accelerate the numerical algorithm, and the convergence of the proposed coarse-to-fine strategy is also established. Some numerical tests are performed to validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.Keywordsimage registrationdiffeomorphismmultiscalecoarse to finemultiresolutionmultigridMSC codes68U1094A0865K1065M12",False,0,,True,0

Using an appropriate model of the resonators (bandpass distributed or lumped element) and shifting the reference planes at the input and output of the filter network, a novel direct synthesis and realization of filters based on frequency variant coupling (inductive or capacitive) in the distributed domain is demonstrated for accurate modeling of narrow and broadband filters. First, a complete general synthesis procedure is described that allows for flexible or mixed topologies realizing transmission zeros anywhere on the frequency plane (including complex and infinite frequencies). Furthermore, by exploiting the power of modular design, a synthesis procedure that enables simultaneous extraction of reflection zero (a pole) and a transmission zero in the form of a symmetrical and physically realizable singlet as an elementary unit is showcased. The physical dimensions of the extracted singlets are independently determined in any chosen technology, and the overall filter is obtained by directly cascading the physical singlets. To validate this novel synthesis technique, three design examples are shown: a narrowband four-pole, four transmission zeros (fully canonical) filter from literature is synthesized and physically dimensioned, a wideband three-pole, three transmission zero (fully canonical) filter, and a broadband three-pole, one transmission zero, filter. In the first two examples, each of the singlet blocks was implemented in an overmoded rectangular waveguide cavity operating at the TE201 mode coupled at the input and output to the fundamental nonresonating TE10 mode. The third example was implemented in a re- entrant coaxial resonator operating at the fundamental mode. The simulation of the electromagnetic (EM) [high-frequency structure simulator (HFSS)] models of the overall example filters was in excellent agreement with the synthesized models, thereby validating the effectiveness of the proposed synthesis technique. Furthermore, the measured results of the fabricated wide bandpass filter showed close agreement with synthesis and EM model.",False,0,,True,0

We compared groups of players who exhibited different play schedules using data slicing and machine learning techniques, to show that players who cluster gameplay into shorter time frames ultimately achieve lower performance levels than those who space their games across longer time windows. Additionally, we found that the timing of intensive play periods does not affect final performance-it is the overall amount of spacing that matters.

We integrate paleobiology, ichnology, sedimentology, and geomorphology to reconstruct Paleozoic terrestrialization. Cambrian landscapes were dominated by laterally mobile rivers with unstable banks in the absence of significant vegetation. Temporary incursions by arthropods and worm-like organisms into coastal environments apparently did not result in establishment of continental communities. Contemporaneous lacustrine faunas may have been inhibited by limited nutrient delivery and high sediment loads. The Ordovician appearance of early land plants triggered a shift in the primary locus of the global clay mineral factory, increasing the amount of mudrock on the continents. The Silurian–Devonian rise of vascular land plants, including the first forests and extensive root systems, was instrumental in further retaining fine sediment on alluvial plains. These innovations led to increased architectural complexity of braided and meandering rivers. Landscape changes were synchronous with establishment of freshwater and terrestrial arthropod faunas in overbank areas, abandoned fluvial channels, lake margins, ephemeral lakes, and inland deserts. Silurian–Devonian lakes experienced improved nutrient availability, due to increased phosphate weathering and terrestrial humic matter. All these changes favoured frequent invasions to permament establishment of jawless and jawed fishes in freshwater habitats and the subsequent tetrapod colonization of the land. The Carboniferous saw rapid diversification of tetrapods, mostly linked to aquatic reproduction, and land plants, including gymnosperms. Deeper root systems promoted further riverbank stabilization, contributing to the rise of anabranching rivers and braided systems with vegetated islands. New lineages of aquatic insects developed and expanded novel feeding modes, including herbivory. Late Paleozoic soils commonly contain pervasive root and millipede traces. Lacustrine animal communities diversified, accompanied by increased food-web complexity and improved food delivery which may have favored permanent colonization of offshore and deep-water lake environments. These trends continued in the Permian, but progressive aridification favored formation of hypersaline lakes, which were stressful for colonization. The Capitanian and end-Permian extinctions affected lacustrine and fluvial biotas, particularly the invertebrate infauna, although burrowing may have allowed some tetrapods to survive associated global warming and increased aridification.",False,0,,True,0

From a cohort of over 2000 patients, we identified twins and triplets discordant for nystagmus. Using next-generation sequencing, high-resolution infra-red pupil tracking and optical coherence tomography, we characterised differences in genotype and phenotype. Monozygotic twins (n = 1), dizygotic twins (n = 3) and triplets (n = 1) were included. The monozygotic twins had concordant TYR variants . No causative variants were identified in the triplets. Dizygotic twins had discordant variants in TYR , OCA2 and FRMD7 . One unaffected co-twin demonstrated sub-clinical nystagmus. Foveal hypoplasia (FH) was noted in four of five probands. Both co-twins of the monozygotic pair and triplets displayed FH. In three families, at least one parent had FH without nystagmus. FH alone may be insufficient to develop nystagmus.

Whereas gene expression in the neocortex is only mildly affected at midgestation, over 600 genes are differentially expressed in the early postnatal neocortex. Genes involved in cell adhesion and axon guidance are particularly prominent amongst the downregulated transcripts. Resting-state functional MRI identified increased synchronized activity in cortico-hippocampal and auditory-parietal networks in Chd8 heterozygous mutant mice, implicating altered connectivity as a potential mechanism underlying the behavioral phenotypes. Together, these data suggest that altered brain growth and diminished expression of important neurodevelopmental genes that regulate long-range brain wiring are followed by distinctive anomalies in functional brain connectivity in Chd8+/− mice. Human imaging studies have reported altered functional connectivity in ASD patients, with long-range under-connectivity seemingly more frequent.

Historians writing from within an increasingly diverse collection of subfields have explored how British attitudes towards, and interventions in, sexual health have changed over the past two centuries. In so doing, they have also addressed a wide range of themes in British social life, politics, gender and sexuality. This article surveys this extensive historiography, highlighting important shifts and reflecting on where historians might fruitfully turn next. Inevitably, there are problematic silences in the scholarship. Historians, overwhelmingly reliant on records compiled by health authorities and the state, have tended to write top‐down histories of sexual health. The lived experiences of ordinary people, especially those on the margins of society, remain frustratingly elusive. Moreover, the same sorts of inequalities that historically undermined care and denied patients a voice continue to shape health outcomes. As such, this article not only surveys the historiography but also makes the case for the important role that historians can play in supporting positive changes in attitudes towards sexual health and the delivery of healthcare today.",False,0,,True,0

We evaluated in this study the deep eutectic solvent mixture (DES) ethaline, which is a mixture of choline chloride and ethylene glycol (1:2), for single-molecule junction fabrication with break-junction techniques. In ethaline, we were able to (i) measure challenging and poorly soluble molecular wires, exploiting the improved solvation capabilities offered by DESs, and (ii) efficiently apply an electrostatic gate able to modulate the conductance of the junction by approximately an order of magnitude within a ∼1 V potential window. The electrochemical gating results on a Au-VDP-Au junction follow exceptionally well the single-level modeling with strong gate coupling (where VDP is 1,2-di(pyridine-4-yl)ethene). Ethaline is also an ideal solvent for the measurement of very short molecular junctions, as it grants a greatly reduced snapback distance of the metallic electrodes upon point-contact rupture.

In this work, heat and mass transfer of the oscillatory gas flow inside a square cavity is computationally studied by solving the Boltzmann model equation, i.e. the Shakhov model. The oscillation frequency of the lid and rarefaction and nonlinearity of the flow field are systematically investigated. Our results show that, when the oscillation frequency of the lid increases, the usual cold-to-hot heat transfer pattern for highly rarefied flow changes to hot-to-cold, which contradicts the well-known anti-Fourier (i.e. cold-to-hot) heat transfer in a non-oscillatory lid-driven cavity. In addition, the thermal convection will be dramatically enhanced by lid oscillation, which may play a dominant role in the heat transfer. Meanwhile, the average Nusselt number varies non-monotonically with the oscillation frequency, with the maximum occurring at the anti-resonance frequency. Finally, the average Nusselt number on the lid at various oscillation frequencies is found to reduce when the gas becomes more rarefied.

In each of these approaches we consider the case where the mapping between states and time points is given by (i) a strict monotonic function and by (ii) a non-strict monotonic function (which allows multiple states to be mapped to the same time point). We use this logic to model examples from robotics, traffic management, and scheduling, discussing the effects of different modelling choices. Our translations allow us to utilise LTL solvers to solve satisfiability and we empirically compare the translations, showing in which cases one performs better than the other. We also define a branching-time version of the logic and provide translations into computation tree logic.",False,0,,True,0

It is an important limiting factor in measuring radial velocity precisely by fibre-fed high-resolution spectrographs. The problem can become particularly severe as the fibre's core become smaller and the number of modes that can propagate reduces. Thus, mitigating modal noise in relatively small core fibres still remains a challenge. We present here a novel technique to suppress modal noise. Two movable mirrors in the form of a galvanometer reimage the mode-pattern of an input fibre to an output fibre. The mixing of modes coupled to the output fibre can be controlled by the movement of mirrors applying two sinusoidal signals through a voltage generator. We test the technique for four multimode circular fibres: 10 and 50 micron step-index, 50 micron graded-index, and a combination of 50 micron graded-index and 5:1 tapered fibres (GI50t). We present the results of mode suppression both in terms of the direct image of the output fibre and spectrum of white light obtained with the high-resolution spectrograph. We found that the galvanometer mitigated modal noise in all the tested fibres, but was most useful for smaller core fibres. However, there is a trade-off between the modal noise reduction and light-loss. The GI50t provides the best result with about 60% mitigation of modal noise at a cost of about 5% output light-loss. Our solution is easy to use and can be implemented in fibre-fed spectrographs.",False,0,,True,1

Of specific importance is the uniformity of Eshelby's tensor $\mathbf{S}$ . Following Eshelby's seminal work, a vast literature has been generated using and developing Eshelby's result and ideas, leading to some beautiful mathematics and extremely useful results in a wide range of application areas. In 1961 Eshelby conjectured that for anisotropic materials only ellipsoidal inhomogeneities would lead to such uniform interior fields. Although much progress has been made since then, the quest to prove this conjecture is still not complete; numerous important problems remain open. Following a different approach to that considered by Eshelby, a closely related tensor $\mathbf{P}=\mathbf{S}\mathbf{D}^{0}$ arises, where $\mathbf{D}^{0}$ is the host medium compliance tensor. The tensor $\mathbf{P}$ is associated with Hill and is of course also uniform when ellipsoidal inhomogeneities are embedded in a homogeneous host phase. Two of the most fundamental and useful areas of applications of these tensors are in Newtonian potential problems such as heat conduction, electrostatics, etc. and in the vector problems of elastostatics. Knowledge of the Hill and Eshelby tensors permit a number of interesting aspects to be studied associated with inhomogeneity problems and more generally for inhomogeneous media. Micromechanical methods established mainly over the last half-century have enabled bounds on and predictions of the effective properties of composite media. In many cases such predictions can be explicitly written down in terms of the Hill tensor, or equivalently the Eshelby tensor and can be shown to provide excellent predictions in many cases. Of specific interest is that a number of important limits of the ellipsoidal inhomogeneity can be taken in order to be employed in predictions of the effective properties of, for example, layered media and fibre reinforced composites and also to the cases when voids and cracks are present. In the main, results for the Hill and Eshelby tensors are distributed over a wide range of articles and books, using different notation and terminology and so it is often difficult to extract the necessary information for the tensor that one requires. The case of an anisotropic host phase is also frequently non-trivial due to the requirement of the associated Green's tensor. Here this classical problem is revisited and a large number of results for problems that are felt to be of great utility in a wide range of disciplines are derived or recalled. A scaling argument leads to the derivation of the Eshelby tensor for potential problems where the host phase is at most orthotropic, without the requirement of using the anisotropic Green's function. The Concentration tensor $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{A}}$ linking interior fields to those imposed in the far-field is derived for a wide variety of problems. These results can therefore be used in the various micromechanical schemes. Directly related to the tensors of Eshelby and Hill is the so-called Moment tensor $\mathbf{M}$ . As well as arising in the literature on micromechanics, this tensor is important in the vast area of research associated with inverse problems and specifically with the problem of identifying an object inside some domain given the application of a specific set of boundary conditions. Due to its fundamental importance and direct link to the Eshelby and Hill tensors, here we state the connection between $\mathbf{M}, \mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{S}$ in an effort to ensure that the work is of use to as wide a community as possible. Both tensor and matrix formulations are considered and contrasted throughout. Appendices give various details that illustrate the implementation of both approaches.",False,0,,True,0

We use the state-of-the-art NEXUS morphological formalism which, due to its multiscale nature, simultaneously identifies structures at all scales. We find strong and highly significant alignments, with both the major axis of haloes and their peculiar velocity tending to orient along the filament. However, the spin - filament alignment displays a more complex trend changing from preferentially parallel at low masses to preferentially perpendicular at high masses. This ""spin flip"" occurs at an average mass of $5\times10^{11}~h^{-1}M_\odot$. This mass increases with increasing filament diameter, varying by more than an order of magnitude between the thinnest and thickest filament samples. We also find that the inner parts of haloes have a spin flip mass that is several times smaller than that of the halo as a whole. These results confirm that recent accretion is responsible for the complex behaviour of the halo spin - filament alignment. Low-mass haloes mainly accrete mass along directions perpendicular to their host filament and thus their spins tend to be oriented along the filaments. In contrast, high-mass haloes mainly accrete along their host filaments and have their spins preferentially perpendicular to them.

Here, we identify a vertebrate Ca2+/H+ exchanger (CAX) as part of a widespread family of homologues in animals. CAX is expressed in neural crest cells and required for their migration in vivo. It localizes to acidic organelles, tempers evoked Ca2+ signals, and regulates cell-matrix adhesion during migration. Our data provide new molecular insight into how Ca2+ is handled by acidic organelles and link this to migration, thereby underscoring the role of noncanonical Ca2+ stores in the control of Ca2+-dependent function.",False,0,,True,0

Here, we provide novel evidence of diurnal variation in AP activity (APA) in the subtropical North Atlantic using two independent datasets, with APA being two‐ to three‐fold higher at night. We demonstrate that zooplankton are a source of AP and postulate that zooplankton DVM is a source of enhanced AP in the surface waters at night, with reduction or degradation of AP during the day. Our results challenge the current assumption that APA is linear over a 24‐h period.

In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe , an important model organism, the variables influencing the rate of sequence evolution have yet to be determined. Previous studies in other single celled organisms have generally found gene expression levels to be most significant, with numerous other variables such as gene length and functional importance identified as having a smaller impact. Using publicly available data, we used partial least squares regression, principal components regression, and partial correlations to determine the variables most strongly associated with sequence evolution constraints. We identify centrality in the protein–protein interactions network, amino acid composition, and cellular location as the most important determinants of sequence conservation. However, each factor only explains a small amount of variance, and there are numerous variables having a significant or heterogeneous influence. Our models explain more than half of the variance in dN, raising the possibility that future refined models could quantify the role of stochastics in evolutionary rate variation.",False,0,,True,0

Assessing welfare, beyond physical indicators of health, is challenging and often relies on qualitative techniques. Behaviour is a key component of welfare to consider and Qualitative Behaviour Assessment (QBA) aims to achieve this by systematically scoring behaviour across specific terms. In recent years, numerous studies have conducted QBA by using video footage, however, the method was not originally developed using video and video QBA (V-QBA) requires validation. Forty live QBAs were conducted, by two assessors, on housed beef cattle to help fill this validation gap. Video was recorded over the assessment period and a second video assessment was conducted. Live and video scores for each term were compared for both correlation and significant difference. Principle component analysis (PCA) was then conducted and correlations and differences between QBA and V-QBA for the first two components were calculated. Of the 20 terms, three were removed due to an overwhelming majority of scores of zero. Of the remaining 17 terms, 12 correlated significantly, and a significant pairwise difference was found for one (""Bored""). QBA and V-QBA results correlated across both PC1 (defined as ""arousal"") and PC2 (defined as ""mood""). Whilst there was no significant difference between the techniques for PC1, there was for PC2, with V-QBA generally yielding lower scores than QBA. Furthermore, based on PC1 and PC2, corresponding QBA and V-QBA scores were significantly closer than would be expected at random. Results found broad agreement between QBA and V-QBA at both univariate and multivariate levels. However, the lack of absolute agreement and muted V-QBA results for PC2 mean that caution should be taken when implementing V-QBA and that it should ideally be treated independently from live QBA until further evidence is published. Future research should focus on a greater variety of animals, environments, and assessors to address further validation of the method.",False,0,,True,0

Here, we addressed the question of how tissue K affects the development of fungal pathogens and whether sensitivity of the pathogens to JA could play a role for the K–disease relationship in barley ( Hordeum vulgare cv. Optic). We report that K‐deprived barley plants showed increased leaf concentrations of JA and other oxylipins. Furthermore, a natural tip‐to‐base K‐concentration gradient within leaves of K‐sufficient plants was quantitatively mirrored by the transcript levels of JA‐responsive genes. The local leaf tissue K concentrations affected the development of two economically important fungi in opposite ways, showing a positive correlation with powdery mildew ( Blumeria graminis ) and a negative correlation with leaf scald ( Rhynchosporium commune ) disease symptoms. B. graminis induced a JA response in the plant and was sensitive to methyl‐JA treatment whereas R. commune initiated no JA response and was JA insensitive. Our study challenges the view that high K generally improves plant health and suggests that JA sensitivity of pathogens could be an important factor in determining the exact K–disease relationship.",False,0,,True,0

We focus on the region in the phase diagram that corresponds to the helical antiferromagnetic phase and find that this region collapses when the uniaxial tension is increased beyond a critical value as low as 600 bar. There are strong reasons to associate this collapse with an underlying Lifshitz transition in the Fermi surface of Tb's valence electrons.

We find seven new roAp stars previously unreported as such and present the analysis of a further 25 roAp stars that are already known. Three of the new stars show multiperiodic pulsations, while all new members are rotationally variable stars, leading to almost 70 per cent (22) of the roAp stars presented being $\alpha^2$ CVn-type variable stars. We show that targeted observations of known chemically peculiar stars are likely to overlook many new roAp stars, and demonstrate that multi-epoch observations are necessary to see pulsational behaviour changes. We find a lack of roAp stars close to the blue edge of the theoretical roAp instability strip, and reaffirm that mode instability is observed more frequently with precise, space-based observations. In addition to the Cycle 2 observations, we analyse TESS data for all known roAp stars. This amounts to 18 further roAp stars observed by TESS. Finally, we list six known roAp stars that TESS is yet to observe. We deduce that the incidence of roAp stars amongst the Ap star population is just 5.5 per cent, raising fundamental questions about the conditions required to excite pulsations in Ap stars.

Here, the authors investigate the contributions of atmospheric wind fluctuations to the mean, variability, and trend of SO wind stress over the last four decades using NCEP reanalysis and ERA-Interim products. Including wind variability at synoptic frequencies (2–8 days) and higher in the stress calculation is found to increase the strength of the mean SO wind stress by almost 40% in both reanalysis products. The southern annular mode index is found to be a good indicator for the strength of the mean wind and mean wind stress, but not as good an indicator for wind fluctuations, at least for the chosen study period. Large discrepancies between reanalysis products emerge regarding the contributions of wind fluctuations to the strengthening trend of SO wind stress. Between one-third and one-half of the stress trend in NCEP can be explained by the increase in the intensity of wind fluctuations, while the stress trend in ERA-Interim is due entirely to the increasing strength of the mean westerly wind. This trend discrepancy may have important climatic implications since the sensitivity of SO circulation to wind stress changes depends strongly on how these stress changes are brought about. Given the important role of wind fluctuations in shaping the SO wind stress, studies of the SO response to wind stress changes need to account for changes of wind fluctuations in the past and future.",False,0,,True,0

Abstract Lactuca sativa L. (lettuce) is an important leafy vegetable crop grown and consumed globally. Chemicals are routinely used to control major pathogens, including the causal agents of grey mould ( Botrytis cinerea ) and lettuce drop ( Sclerotinia sclerotiorum ) . With increasing prevalence of pathogen resistance to fungicides and environmental concerns, there is an urgent need to identify sources of genetic resistance to B. cinerea and S. sclerotiorum in lettuce. We demonstrated genetic variation for quantitative resistance to B. cinerea and S. sclerotiorum in a set of 97 diverse lettuce and wild relative accessions, and between the parents of lettuce mapping populations. Transcriptome profiling across multiple lettuce accessions enabled us to identify genes with expression correlated with resistance, predicting the importance of post-transcriptional gene regulation in the lettuce defence response. We identified five genetic loci influencing quantitative resistance in a F 6 mapping population derived from a Lactuca serriola (wild relative) × lettuce cross, which each explained 5–10% of the variation. Differential gene expression analysis between the parent lines, and integration of data on correlation of gene expression and resistance in the diversity set, highlighted potential causal genes underlying the quantitative trait loci.",False,0,,True,0

For fermentative production of the cholesterol-lowering drug pravastatin, the stereoselectivity of the enzyme needs to be inverted, which has been partially achieved by error-prone PCR mutagenesis and screening. In the current study, we report further optimization of the stereoselectivity by a computationally aided approach. Using the CoupledMoves protocol of Rosetta, a virtual library of mutants was designed to bind compactin in a pro-pravastatin orientation. By examining the frequency of occurrence of beneficial substitutions and rational inspection of their interactions, a small set of eight mutants was predicted to show the desired selectivity and these variants were tested experimentally. The best CYP105AS1 variant gave >99% stereoselective hydroxylation of compactin to pravastatin, with complete elimination of the unwanted 6-epi-pravastatin diastereomer. The enzyme-substrate complexes were also examined by ultrashort molecular dynamics simulations of 50 × 100 ps and 5 × 22 ns, which revealed that the frequency of occurrence of near-attack conformations agreed with the experimentally observed stereoselectivity. These results show that a combination of computational methods and rational inspection could improve CYP105AS1 stereoselectivity beyond what was obtained by directed evolution.

We apply TWA to conduct a multi-perspective impact assessment of sea level rise in Singapore, evaluating vulnerable buildings, road networks, land plots, cultural sites, and populations. We introduce OntoSeaLevel, an ontology to describe sea level rise scenarios, and its impact on broader elements defined in other ontologies such as buildings (OntoBuiltEnv ontology), road networks (OpenStreetMap ontology), and land plots (Ontoplot and Ontozoning ontology). We deploy computational agents to synthesise data from government, industry, and other publicly accessible sources, enriching buildings with metadata such as property usage, estimated construction cost, number of floors, and gross floor area. An agent is applied to identify and instantiate the impacted sites using OntoSeaLevel. These sites include vulnerable buildings, land plots, cultural sites, and populations at risk.

One outstanding problem is that there is a fundamental mismatch between space‐based and ionospheric estimates of the flux that is opened by each flux transfer event—in other words, their overall significance in the Dungey cycle. Spacecraft‐based estimates of the flux content of individual flux transfer events (FTEs) correspond to each event transferring flux equivalent to approximately 1% of the open flux in the magnetosphere, whereas studies based on global‐scale radar and auroral observations suggest this figure could be of the order of 10%. In the former case, flux transfer events would be a minor detail in the Dungey cycle, but in the latter they could be its main driver. We present observations of two conjunctions between flux transfer events observed by the Cluster spacecraft and pulsed ionospheric flows observed by the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) network. In both cases, a similar number of FTE signatures were observed by Cluster and one of the SuperDARN radars, but the conjunctions differ in the azimuthal separation of the spacecraft and ionospheric observations (i.e., the distance of the spacecraft from the cusp throat). We argue that the reason for the existing mismatch in flux estimates is due to implicit assumptions made about FTE structure, which tacitly ignore the majority of flux opened in mechanisms based on longer reconnection lines. If the effects of such mechanisms are considered, a much better match is found.",False,0,,True,0

Here, we developed light-activated molecules based on the conjugation of the FDA-approved photosensitizer riboflavin to the Gram-positive specific ligand vancomycin to enable targeted antimicrobial photodynamic therapy. The riboflavin-vancomycin conjugate proved to be a potent and versatile antibacterial agent, enabling the rapid, light-mediated, killing of MRSA and VRE with no significant off-target effects. The attachment of riboflavin on vancomycin also led to an increase in antibiotic activity against S. aureus and VRE. Simultaneously, we evidenced for the first time that the flavin subunit undergoes an efficient photoinduced bond cleavage reaction to release vancomycin, thereby acting as a photoremovable protecting group with potential applications in drug delivery.",False,0,,True,0

We prove that: (i) the computed approximations bound the measures from below; (ii) the total variation distances between the approximations and the measures decrease monotonically as states are added to the truncation; and (iii) the scheme converges, in the sense that, as the truncation tends to the entire state space, the total variation distances tend to zero. Furthermore, we give a computable bound on the total variation distance between the exit distribution and its approximation, and we delineate the cases in which the bound is sharp. We also revisit the related finite state projection scheme and give a comprehensive account of its theoretical properties. We demonstrate the use of the ETFSP scheme by applying it to two biological examples: the computation of the first passage time associated with the expression of a gene, and the fixation times of competing species subject to demographic noise.",False,0,,True,0

Wnt/β-catenin signaling is also regulated by a much larger set of 'non-core regulators'. However the relationship between 'non-core regulators' is currently not well understood. Aberrant activation of the pathway has been shown to drive tumorgenesis in a number of different tissues. Mammalian cells engineered to have a partially-active level of Wnt/β-catenin signaling were screened by transfection for proteins that up or down-regulated a mid-level of TCF-dependent transcription induced by transient expression of an activated LRP6 Wnt co-receptor (∆NLRP). 141 novel regulators of TCF-dependent transcription were identified. Surprisingly, when tested without ∆NLRP activation, most up-regulators failed to alter TCF-dependent transcription. However, when expressed in pairs, 27 % (466/1170) functionally interacted to alter levels of TCF-dependent transcription. When proteins were displayed as nodes connected by their ability to co-operate in the regulation of TCF-dependent transcription, a network of functional interactions was revealed. In this network, 'core pathway' components (Eg. β-catenin, GSK-3, Dsh) were found to be the most highly connected nodes. Activation of different nodes in this network impacted on the sensitivity to Wnt pathway small molecule antagonists. The 'functional connectome' identified here strongly supports an alternative model of the Wnt pathway as a complex context-dependent network. The network further suggests that mutational activation of highly connected Wnt signaling nodes predisposed cells to further context-dependent alterations in levels of TCF-dependent transcription that may be important during tumor progression and treatment.",False,0,,True,0

Furthermore, the main mzIdentML specification document can now be supplemented by extension documents which provide further guidance for encoding specific use cases for different proteomics subfields. One extension document has been added, covering additional use cases for the encoding of crosslinked peptide identifications. The ability to add extension documents facilitates keeping the mzIdentML standard up to date with advances in the proteomics field, without having to change the main specification document. The crosslinking extension document provides further explanation of the crosslinking use cases already supported in mzIdentML version 1.2.0, and provides support for encoding additional scenarios that are critical to reflect developments in the crosslinking field and facilitate its integration in structural biology. These are: (i) support for cleavable crosslinkers, (ii) support for internally linked peptides, (iii) support for noncovalently associated peptides, and (iv) improved support for encoding scores and the corresponding thresholds.",False,0,,True,0

Both choices of outcome definitions and approaches to handling events happening post-randomisation can change the treatment effect being estimated, but these are often inconsistently described, thus inhibiting clear interpretation and comparison across trials. Methods Starting from the ICH E9(R1) addendum’s definition of an estimand, we use our experience of conducting large Phase III tuberculosis treatment trials and our understanding of the estimand framework to identify the key decisions regarding how different event types are handled in the primary outcome definition, and the important points that should be considered in making such decisions. A key issue is the handling of intercurrent (i.e. post-randomisation) events (ICEs) which affect interpretation of or preclude measurement of the intended final outcome. We consider common ICEs including treatment changes and treatment extension, poor adherence to randomised treatment, re-infection with a new strain of tuberculosis which is different from the original infection, and death. We use two completed tuberculosis trials (REMoxTB and STREAM Stage 1) as illustrative examples. These trials tested non-inferiority of new tuberculosis treatment regimens versus a control regimen. The primary outcome was a binary composite endpoint, ‘favourable’ or ‘unfavourable’, which was constructed from several components. Results We propose the following improvements in handling the above-mentioned ICEs and loss to follow-up (a post-randomisation event that is not in itself an ICE). First, changes to allocated regimens should not necessarily be viewed as an unfavourable outcome; from the patient perspective, the potential harms associated with a change in the regimen should instead be directly quantified. Second, handling poor adherence to randomised treatment using a per-protocol analysis does not necessarily target a clear estimand; instead, it would be desirable to develop ways to estimate the treatment effects more relevant to programmatic settings. Third, re-infection with a new strain of tuberculosis could be handled with different strategies, depending on whether the outcome of interest is the ability to attain culture negativity from infection with any strain of tuberculosis, or specifically the presenting strain of tuberculosis. Fourth, where possible, death could be separated into tuberculosis-related and non-tuberculosis-related and handled using appropriate strategies. Finally, although some losses to follow-up would result in early treatment discontinuation, patients lost to follow-up before the end of the trial should not always be classified as having an unfavourable outcome.

Here, we report two naphthalene-based RTP luminophores whose phosphorescence emission is enabled by radiative decay of high-lying triplet excitons. In contrast, upon cooling the dominant phosphorescence originates from the lowest-lying triplet excited state, which is manifested by a red-shifted emission. Photophysical and theoretical studies reveal that the unusual RTP results from thermally activated excitonic coupling between different conformations of the compounds. Aggregation-regulated excitonic coupling is observed when increasing the doping concentration of the emitters in poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA). Further, the RTP quantum efficiency improves more than 80-fold in 1,3-bis(N-carbazolyl)benzene (mCP) compared to that in PMMA.

It is shown that decreasing electrode width increases the power density at a fixed operating voltage, causing an intensification of the oscillatory flow by up to 200%, resulting from the overlap of localized flows at every discharge gap. This intensification introduces ripples in the flux of species to a downstream surface when the distance between the SBD array and the treated surface is reduced. A transition between a convection‐driven delivery and diffusion‐driven delivery was identified and quantified for different electrode widths and distances between SBDs and the treated surface. The work shows that the ripples in the delivered flux were associated with convection‐driven delivery.",False,0,,True,0

We investigate this using the cosmological simulation suite FABLE, with a particular focus on the dwarf regime ($M_\mathrm{stellar} < 10^{9.5} \ \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$). We find that overmassive black holes (BHs), with respect to the mean scaling relations with their host galaxies, drive hotter and faster outflows and lead to significantly reduced gas mass fractions. They are also more likely to display a kinematically misaligned ionized gas component in our mock MaNGA velocity maps, although we caution that cosmic inflows and mergers contribute to misalignments as well. While in the local Universe the majority of AGN in dwarfs are much dimmer than the stellar component, for $z \geq 2$ there is a significant population that outshines their hosts. These high-redshift overmassive BHs contribute to the quenching of dwarfs, whereas at late cosmic times supernova (SN) feedback is more efficient. While our results are overall in good agreement with X-ray observations of AGN in dwarfs, the lack of high-luminosity X-ray AGN in FABLE at low redshifts highlights an interesting possibility that SN feedback could be too strong in FABLE's dwarfs, curtailing AGN growth and feedback. We predict that future observations may uncover many more AGN in dwarfs with lower luminosities and at higher redshifts.",False,0,,True,0

However child weight could also 'elicit' PFPs. A novel approach is to investigate gene-environment correlation between child genetic influences on BMI and PFPs. Genome-wide polygenic scores (GPS) combining BMI-associated variants were created for 10,346 children (including 3,320 DZ twin pairs) from the Twins Early Development Study using results from an independent genome-wide association study meta-analysis. Parental 'restriction' and 'pressure' were assessed using the Child Feeding Questionnaire. Child BMI standard deviation scores (BMI-SDS) were calculated from children's height and weight at age 10. Linear regression and fixed family effect models were used to test between- (n = 4,445 individuals) and within-family (n = 2,164 DZ pairs) associations between the GPS and PFPs. In addition, we performed multivariate twin analyses (n = 4,375 twin pairs) to estimate the heritabilities of PFPs and the genetic correlations between BMI-SDS and PFPs. The GPS was correlated with BMI-SDS (β = 0.20, p = 2.41x10-38). Consistent with the gene-environment correlation hypothesis, child BMI GPS was positively associated with 'restriction' (β = 0.05, p = 4.19x10-4), and negatively associated with 'pressure' (β = -0.08, p = 2.70x10-7). These results remained consistent after controlling for parental BMI, and after controlling for overall family contributions (within-family analyses). Heritabilities for 'restriction' (43% [40–47%]) and 'pressure' (54% [50–59%]) were moderate-to-high. Twin-based genetic correlations were moderate and positive between BMI-SDS and 'restriction' (rA = 0.28 [0.23–0.32]), and substantial and negative between BMI-SDS and 'pressure' (rA = -0.48 [-0.52 - -0.44]. Results suggest that the degree to which parents limit or encourage children's food intake is partly influenced by children's genetic predispositions to higher or lower BMI. These findings point to an evocative gene-environment correlation in which heritable characteristics in the child elicit parental feeding behaviour.",False,0,,True,0

This zooplankton prey energy has significantly and dramatically declined over much of the northeast Atlantic, and specifically within key salmon migration domains, over the past 60 years. Marine return rates from a set of southern European populations are found to exhibit clustering not entirely predictable from geographical proximity. Variability in grouped return rates from these populations is correlated with zooplankton energy on a range of scales, demonstrating the potential use of zooplankton energy as an indicator of salmon marine survival. Comparison with environmental variables derived from ocean model reanalysis data suggests zooplankton energy is regulated by a combination of climate change impacts on ecosystem productivity and multi-decadal variability in water mass influence along the migration routes.",False,0,,True,0

However, it is unclear whether morphologic abnormalities of the brain in GGE are a consequence of repeated seizures over the duration of the disease, or are a consequence of treatment with antiepileptic drugs ( AED s), or are independent of these factors. Therefore, we measured brain morphometry in a cohort of AED‐naive patients with GGE at disease onset. We hypothesize that drug‐naive patients at disease onset have gray matter changes compared to age‐matched healthy controls. Methods We performed quantitative measures of gray matter volume in the thalamus, putamen, caudate, pallidum, hippocampus, precuneus, prefrontal cortex, precentral cortex, and cingulate in 29 AED‐naive patients with new‐onset GGE and compared them to 32 age‐matched healthy controls. We subsequently compared the shape of any brain structures found to differ in gray matter volume between the groups. Results The thalamus was the only structure to show reduced gray matter volume in AED‐naive patients with new‐onset GGE compared to healthy controls. Shape analysis revealed that the thalamus showed deflation, which was not uniformly distributed, but particularly affected a circumferential strip involving anterior, superior, posterior, and inferior regions with sparing of medial and lateral regions. Significance Structural abnormalities in the thalamus are present at the initial onset of GGE in AED ‐naive patients, suggesting that thalamic structural abnormality is an intrinsic feature of GGE and not a consequence of AED s or disease duration.",False,0,,True,1

In each trial, infant participants were presented with a visual stimulus (e.g., a round shape) followed by a novel spoken word that either sound-symbolically matched (""moma"") or mismatched (""kipi"") the shape. Amplitude increase in the gamma band showed perceptual integration of visual and auditory stimuli in the match condition within 300 msec of word onset. Furthermore, phase synchronization between electrodes at around 400 msec revealed intensified large-scale, left-hemispheric communication between brain regions in the mismatch condition as compared to the match condition, indicating heightened processing effort when integration was more demanding. Finally, event-related brain potentials showed an increased adult-like N400 response - an index of semantic integration difficulty - in the mismatch as compared to the match condition. Together, these findings suggest that 11-month-old infants spontaneously map auditory language onto visual experience by recruiting a cross-modal perceptual processing system and a nascent semantic network within the first year of life.",False,0,,True,1

The inhibition task included an excitatory training stage and summation and retardation tests. Difference scores were used to help control for individual variation in baseline nosepoke responding. NOR was tested after a 10 min delay, following 24hr delay and using a recency variant. Discrimination ratios were used to control for individual variation in exploratory activity.

We believe our proposed encryptor is unique in the way that it combines on-demand programmable encryption algorithms with a 100G Ethernet network interface to provide a high-transmission capacity with flexible security. We have successfully formed an on-demand encryption library consisting of AES-256, AES-192, AES-128, Camellia-256, XOR, and no-encryption configurations. Our system has shown a network throughput of 91.3 Gb/s for AES variations and 90.2 Gb/s for Camellia-256, while theoretical encryption throughputs were 160 Gb/s. In addition, the goodputs of all the encryption schemes were measured as at least 90.4 Gb/s. For a faster reconfiguration of the field-programmable gate array (FPGA), partial reconfiguration technology has been used, and reconfiguration times of 2.6 s for encryption and 2 s for decryption have been achieved. The FPGA configuration rate was 3.35 MB/s. When our proposed design was tested in a QKD use case with 256-bit keys, the highest achieved key consumption rate was 27 keys/s, which corresponded to the minimum granularity of 474 MB per key. Thus, with a 256-bit key, up to a 6912 b/s key consumption rate was achieved.

In late‐stage clinical trials, it is common to handle IEs like ‘treatment discontinuation’ using the treatment policy strategy and target the treatment effect on outcomes regardless of treatment discontinuation. For continuous repeated measures, this type of effect is often estimated using all observed data before and after discontinuation using either a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) or multiple imputation (MI) to handle any missing data. In basic form, both these estimation methods ignore treatment discontinuation in the analysis and therefore may be biased if there are differences in patient outcomes after treatment discontinuation compared with patients still assigned to treatment, and missing data being more common for patients who have discontinued treatment. We therefore propose and evaluate a set of MI models that can accommodate differences between outcomes before and after treatment discontinuation. The models are evaluated in the context of planning a Phase 3 trial for a respiratory disease. We show that analyses ignoring treatment discontinuation can introduce substantial bias and can sometimes underestimate variability. We also show that some of the MI models proposed can successfully correct the bias, but inevitably lead to increases in variance. We conclude that some of the proposed MI models are preferable to the traditional analysis ignoring treatment discontinuation, but the precise choice of MI model will likely depend on the trial design, disease of interest and amount of observed and missing data following treatment discontinuation.",False,0,,True,0

Height tempo (which corresponds to age at peak height velocity (aPHV)) was estimated from serial height measurements collected between age 5–20 years. Multivariable linear regression was used to examine cross-sectional associations between height tempo and the top ten HSMs at age 14 and 18, adjusting for sex and fat mass index (FMI). Complete outcome and covariate data were available from 3827 and 3507 participants at age 14 and 18 years, respectively. Mean aPHV was 13.5 and 11.8 years for males and females, respectively. At age 14, height tempo was associated with a majority of modes, except for HSM4 and there was strong evidence of interaction by sex. In males, all modes showed evidence of an association with tempo, independent of FMI, with the strongest observed for HSM8 (adjusted β 0.38 (0.33, 0.43) p = 4.1 × 10−50). Compared with males, the associations were generally weaker in females, with the strongest effect observed for HSM8 (adjusted β 0.10 (0.05, 0.14) p = 1.6 × 10−5). The overall effect of later pubertal timing on proximal femur shape in males was a narrower femoral neck and larger superolateral head, whereas in females these changes were hard to discern. When assessed at age 18, there was little relationship between tempo and proximal femur shape in either sex. Our results indicate that significant changes in hip shape occur during puberty, including aspects of shape which may be related to future risk of hip OA and/or fracture. However, puberty timing per se does not appear to exert long lasting effects on proximal femur shape.",False,0,,True,1

Post-translational modifications (PTMs), like SUMOylation, play a vital role in the regulation of plant responses to their environment. The process of SUMOylation typically involves an enzymatic cascade containing the activation, (E1), conjugation (E2), and ligation (E3) of SUMO to a target protein. Additionally, it also requires a class of SUMO proteases that generate mature SUMO from its precursor and cleave it off the target protein, a process termed deSUMOylation. It is now clear that SUMOylation in plants is key to a plethora of adaptive responses. How this is achieved with an extremely limited set of machinery components is still unclear. One possibility is that novel SUMO components are yet to be discovered. However, current knowledge indicates that only a small set of enzymes seem to be responsible for the modification of a large number of SUMO substrates. It is yet unknown where the specificity lies within the SUMO system. Although this seems to be a crucial question in the field of SUMOylation studies, not much is known about the factors that provide specificity. In this review, we highlight the role of the localisation of SUMO components as an important factor that can play a vital role in contributing to the specificity within the process. This will introduce a new facet to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying such a dynamic process.",False,0,,True,0

With terminal patients increasingly seeking and sharing health information and support via social media, it is timely to examine whether these trajectories are reflected in their digital narratives. In this exploratory study, we analysed the Twitter feed of prominent cancer sufferer and physician, Kate Granger, over the final 6 months of her life. With the consent of Kate's widower, Chris Pointon, 1628 Twitter posts from @GrangerKate were manually screened. The 550 tweets judged relevant to her disease were qualitatively content analysed with reference to the six modifiable dimensions of the patient experience in Emanuel and Emanuel's 'framework for a good death'. The frequency of each tweet category was charted over time and textual content was examined and cross-referenced with key events, to obtain a deeper understanding of its nature and significance. Tweets were associated with physical symptoms (N = 270), psychological and cognitive symptoms (N = 213), social relationships and support (N = 85), economic demands and care giving needs (N = 85), hopes and expectations (N = 51) and spiritual beliefs (N = 7). While medical treatments and procedures were discussed in detail, medical information-seeking was largely absent, likely reflecting Kate clinical expertise. Spirituality was expressed more as hope in treatments or ""someone out there listening"", than in religious terms. The high value of Kate's palliative care team was a dominant theme in the support category, alongside the support she received from her online community of fellow sufferers, friends, family and colleagues. Significant events, such as medical procedures and hospital stays generated the densest Twitter engagement. Transitions between trajectory phases were marked by changes in the relative frequency of tweet-types. In Kate's words, ""the power of patient narrative cannot be underestimated"". While this analysis spanned only 6 months, it yielded rich insights. The results reflect theorised end-of-life dimensions and reveal the potential of social media data and digital bio-ethnography to shine a light on terminal patients' lived experiences, coping strategies and support needs, suggesting new opportunities for enhancing personalised palliative care and avenues for further research.",False,0,,True,0

The development of thickness as a function of time of a solute-free liquid (toluene) and a blend of polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate) cast from toluene were fitted to different models as a function of toluene partial pressure. In the case of the formation of the polymer blend film, a concentration-dependent (Huggins) viscosity formula was used to account for changes in viscosity during spin coating. A semi-empirical model is introduced, which permits calculation of the solvent evaporation rate and the temporal evolution of the solute volume fraction and solution viscosity.",False,0,,True,0

Significant age differences were found; however, this is not a straightforward relationship. Older users appear less likely to secure their devices compared to younger users; however, the reverse was found for the other behaviours, with older users appearing more likely to generate secure passwords and show proactive risk awareness and regularly install updates. Gender was not a significant predictor of security behaviour (although males scored higher for self-reported computer self-efficacy and general resilience). Self-efficacy was identified as a mediator between age and three of the cybersecurity behaviours (password generation, proactive checking, and updating). General resilience was also a significant mediator for device securement, password generation, and updating; however, resilience acted as a moderator for proactive checking. Implications of these findings are twofold: firstly, helping to guide the development of training and interventions tailored to different cybersecurity behaviours and secondly informing cybersecurity policy development.",False,0,,True,0

In response to deceptive courtship, budding yeast escapes pheromone-induced cell-cycle arrest through the coalescence of the G1/S inhibitor Whi3 into a dominant, inactive super-assembly. Whi3 is a mnemon (Whi3mnem), a protein that conformational change maintains as a trait in the mother cell but is not inherited by the daughter cells. How the maintenance and asymmetric inheritance of Whi3mnem are achieved is unknown. Here, we report that Whi3mnem is closely associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes and is retained in the mother cell by the lateral diffusion barriers present at the bud neck. Strikingly, barrier defects made Whi3mnem propagate in a mitotically stable, prion-like manner. The amyloid-forming glutamine-rich domain of Whi3 was required for both mnemon and prion-like behaviors. Thus, we propose that Whi3mnem is in a self-templating state, lending temporal maintenance of memory, whereas its association with the compartmentalized membranes of the ER prevents infectious propagation to the daughter cells. These results suggest that confined self-templating super-assembly is a powerful mechanism for the long-term encoding of information in a spatially defined manner. Yeast courtship may provide insights on how individual synapses become potentiated in neuronal memory.",False,0,,True,0

One problem with this design is its inherent repeated measures necessitate the availability of an estimate of the within-person standard deviation (SD) to perform a sample size calculation, which may be rarely available at the design stage of a trial. Interim sample size re-estimation designs can be used to help alleviate this issue by adapting the sample size mid-way through the trial, using accrued information in a statistically robust way. Methods The AIM HY-INFORM study is part of the Informative Markers in Hypertension (AIM HY) Programme and comprises two crossover trials, each with a planned recruitment of 600 participants. The objective of the study is to test whether blood pressure response to first line antihypertensive treatment depends on ethnicity. An interim analysis is planned to reassess the assumptions of the planned sample size for the study. The aims of this paper are: (1) to provide a formula for sample size re-estimation in both crossover trials; and (2) to present a simulation study of the planned interim analysis to investigate alternative within-person SDs to that assumed. Results The AIM HY-INFORM protocol sample size calculation fixes the within-person SD to be 8 mmHg, giving &gt; 90% power for a primary treatment effect of 4 mmHg. Using the method developed here and simulating the interim sample size reassessment, if we were to see a larger within-person SD of 9 mmHg at interim, 640 participants for 90% power 90% of the time in the three-period three-treatment design would be required. Similarly, in the four-period four-treatment crossover design, 602 participants would be required. Conclusions The formulas presented here provide a method for re-estimating the sample size in crossover trials. In the context of the AIM HY-INFORM study, simulating the interim analysis allows us to explore the results of a possible increase in the within-person SD from that assumed. Simulations show that without increasing the planned sample size of 600 participants, we can reasonably still expect to achieve 80% power with a small increase in the within-person SD from that assumed.

This effect could be explained in terms of shy children's aversion to unfamiliarity disrupting the requisite attentional processes, because the task is marked by a high degree of unfamiliarity. To test this argument, we examined whether increasing the familiarity of the task facilitates shy children's ability to form and retain word meanings. Two‐year‐old children ( N = 23) took part in a word learning task in which their caregiver acted as the experimenter. On referent selection trials, children were presented with sets of three objects, one novel and two familiar, and were asked for either a familiar object using its known label, or a novel object using a novel word. Children were then tested on their retention of the previously formed novel word‐object mappings. In this context of increased familiarity, shyness was unrelated to performance on referent selection trials. However, shyness was positively related to children's retention of the word‐object mappings, meaning that shyer children outperformed less‐shy children on this measure of word learning. These findings show that context‐based familiarity interacts with intrinsic individual differences to affect word learning performance.",False,0,,True,0

We previously showed that the ability of R. gnavus to forage on mucins is strain-dependent and associated with sialic acid metabolism. Here, we showed that mice monocolonized with R. gnavus ATCC 29149 (Rg-mice) display changes in major sialic acid derivatives in their cecum content, blood, and brain, which is accompanied by a significant decrease in the percentage of sialylated residues in intestinal mucins relative to germ-free (GF) mice. Changes in metabolites associated with brain function such as tryptamine, indolacetate, and trimethylamine N-oxide were also detected in the cecal content of Rg-mice when compared to GF mice. Next, we investigated the effect of R. gnavus monocolonization on hippocampus cell proliferation and behavior. We observed a significant decrease of PSA-NCAM immunoreactive granule cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) of Rg-mice as compared to GF mice and recruitment of phagocytic microglia in the vicinity. Behavioral assessments suggested an improvement of the spatial working memory in Rg-mice but no change in other cognitive functions. These results were also supported by a significant upregulation of genes involved in proliferation and neuroplasticity. Collectively, these data provide first insights into how R. gnavus metabolites may influence brain regulation and function through modulation of granule cell development and synaptic plasticity in the adult hippocampus.

While many actors may send messages to some actor, only the actor may (selectively) receive from its mailbox. Although actors eliminate many of the issues stemming from shared memory concurrency, they remain vulnerable to communication errors such as protocol violations and deadlocks. Mailbox types are a novel behavioural type system for mailboxes first introduced for a process calculus by de’Liguoro and Padovani in 2018, which capture the contents of a mailbox as a commutative regular expression. Due to aliasing and nested evaluation contexts, moving from a process calculus to a programming language is challenging. This paper presents Pat, the first programming language design incorporating mailbox types, and describes an algorithmic type system. We make essential use of quasi-linear typing to tame some of the complexity introduced by aliasing. Our algorithmic type system is necessarily co-contextual, achieved through a novel use of backwards bidirectional typing, and we prove it sound and complete with respect to our declarative type system. We implement a prototype type checker, and use it to demonstrate the expressiveness of Pat on a factory automation case study and a series of examples from the Savina actor benchmark suite.",False,0,,True,0

It is based on the premise that K + ions maintain a complete hydration shell while passing between the transmembrane cavity and cytosol, which must be accommodated. To put the canonical model to the test, we locked the conformation of a Kir K + channel to prevent widening of the narrow collar. Unexpectedly, conduction was unimpaired in the locked channels. In parallel, we employed all-atom molecular dynamics to simulate K + ions moving along the conduction pathway between the lower cavity and cytosol. During simulations, the constriction did not significantly widen. Instead, transient loss of some water molecules facilitated K + permeation through the collar. The low free energy barrier to partial dehydration in the absence of conformational change indicates Kir channels are not gated by the canonical mechanism.",False,0,,True,0

The molecular encapsulation enables a detailed understanding of the effect of interpolymer interactions. We reveal that the non-encapsulated analogue P(NDI-2OD-T) undergoes aggregation enhanced emission; an effect that is suppressed upon encapsulation due to an increasing π-interchain stacking distance.

Resource availability is a key driver of animal space use, which in turn influences interspecific interactions like intraguild competition. Understanding how climate-induced changes in resource availability influence animal space use, and how species-specific responses scale up to affect intraguild dynamics, is necessary for predicting broader community-level responses to climatic changes. Although several studies have demonstrated the ecological impacts of drought, the behavioural responses of individuals that scale up to these broader-scale effects are not well known, particularly among animals in top trophic levels like large carnivores. Furthermore, we currently lack understanding of how the impacts of climate variability on individual carnivore behaviour are linked to intraguild dynamics, in part because multi-species datasets collected at timescales relevant to climatic changes are rare. Using 11 years of GPS data from four sympatric large carnivore species in southern Africa-lions (Panthera leo), leopards (Panthera pardus), African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) and cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus)-spanning 4 severe drought events, we test whether drought conditions impact (1) large carnivore space use, (2) broad-scale intraguild spatial overlap and (3) fine-scale intraguild interactions. Drought conditions expanded space use across species, with carnivores increasing their monthly home range sizes by 35% (wild dogs) to 66% (leopards). Drought conditions increased the amount of spatial overlap between lions and subordinate felids (cheetahs and leopards) by up to 119%, but only lion-cheetah encounter rates were affected by these changes, declining in response to drought. Our findings reveal that drought has a clear signature on the space use of multiple sympatric large carnivore species, which can alter spatiotemporal partitioning between competing species. Our study thereby illuminates the links between environmental change, animal behaviour and intraguild dynamics. While fine-scale avoidance strategies may facilitate intraguild coexistence during periodic droughts, large carnivore conservation may require considerable expansion of protected areas or revised human-carnivore coexistence strategies to accommodate the likely long-term increased space demands of large carnivores under projected increases in drought intensity.",False,0,,True,0

The functions of the mammalian urothelium, lining the majority of the urinary tract and providing a barrier against toxins in urine, are dependent on the correct differentiation of urothelial cells, relying on protein expression, modification, and complex assembly to regulate the formation of multiple differentiated cell layers. Protein glycosylation, a poorly studied aspect of urothelial differentiation, contributes to the apical glycome and is implicated in the development of urothelial diseases. To enable surface glycome characterization, we developed a method to collect tissue apical surface N- and O-glycans. A simple, novel device using basic laboratory supplies was developed for enzymatic shaving of the luminal bladder urothelial surface, with subsequent release and mass spectrometric analysis of apical surface O- and N-glycans, the first normal mammalian urothelial N-glycome to be defined. Trypsinization of superficial glycoproteins was tracked using immunolabeling of the apically expressed uroplakin 3a protein to optimize enzymatic release, without compromising the integrity of the superficial urothelial layer. The approach developed for releasing apical tissue surface glycans allowed for comparison with the N-glycome of the total porcine bladder urothelial cells and thus identification of apical surface glycans as candidates implicated in the urothelial barrier function.

As a result, a vast number of approaches limiting their expressive power—in order to obtain better computational behaviour—have been introduced. Unfortunately, due to such restrictions, interval logics often lose referentiality, that is, the capacity to refer to specific time intervals, which is crucial for temporal representation and reasoning. The computational price that needs to be paid in order to regain referentiality is not well studied and our research aims to fill this gap. In particular we study the main interval temporal logic, called the Halpern-Shoham logic, and its low complexity modifications. To regain referentiality in these modifications, we extend the language with the hybrid machinery—nominals and satisfaction operators—and classify the obtained logics according to their computational complexity. We show that such a hybridisation often makes tractable logics intractable but not undecidable. This allows us to construct hybrid interval temporal logics which are referential as well as maintain a good compromise between expressiveness and complexity; it makes them valuable formalisms for temporal knowledge representation. We also introduce a class of models which, due to a specific interplay between the interpretation of modal operators and a structure of time, makes reasoning in interval logics computationally hard even in the absence of the hybrid machinery.",False,0,,True,1

The protrusion phenotype required protrudin, a RAB-interacting protein that interacts with spastin and localises to ER–endosome contact sites, where it promotes KIF5-dependent endosomal motility to protrusions. Consistent with this, the protrusion phenotype in cells lacking spastin also required KIF5. Lack or mutation of spastin resulted in functional consequences for receptor traffic of a pathway implicated in HSP, as Bone Morphogenetic Protein receptor distribution became polarised. Our results, therefore, identify a novel role for ESCRT-III proteins and spastin in regulating polarised membrane traffic.",False,0,,True,1

Understanding how these inequalities vary by country and place of delivery (home or facility) will allow targeting of interventions to those who need them most. We describe socio-economic inequalities in newborn care in rural areas of Bangladesh, Nepal and India for all deliveries and by place of delivery.We used data from surveillance sites in Bangladesh, India and from Makwanpur and Dhanusha districts in Nepal, covering periods from 2001 to 2011. We used literacy (ability to read a short text) as indicator of socioeconomic status. We developed a composite score of nine newborn care practices (score range 0-9 indicating infants received no newborn care to all nine newborn care practices). We modeled the effect of literacy and place of delivery on the newborn care score and on individual practices.In all study sites (60,078 deliveries in total), use of facility delivery was higher among literate mothers. In all sites, inequalities in newborn care were observed: the difference in new born care between literate and illiterate ranged 0.35-0.80. The effect of literacy on the newborn care score reduced after adjusting for place of delivery (range score difference literate-illiterate: 0.21-0.43).Socioeconomic inequalities in facility care greatly contribute to inequalities in newborn care. Improving newborn care during home deliveries and improving access to facility care are a priority for addressing inequalities in newborn care and newborn mortality.",False,0,,True,0

We used routine Read Code data and interviews with General Practitioners (GPs) to assess their impact. A sequential explanatory mixed-methods study was conducted in 16 general practices representing 106,700 patients and 99 GPs across two areas in Northern England. Data were extracted on screening and brief alcohol intervention delivery for 2010-11 and rates were calculated by practice incentive status. Semi-structured interviews with 14 GPs explored which factors influence intervention delivery and recording in routine consultations. Screening and brief alcohol intervention rates were higher in financially incentivised compared to non-incentivised practices. However absolute rates were low across all practices. Rates of short screening test administration ranged from 0.05% (95% CI: 0.03-0.08) in non-incentivised practices to 3.92% (95% CI: 3.70-4.14) in nationally incentivised practices. For the full AUDIT, rates were also highest in nationally incentivised practices (3.68%, 95% CI: 3.47-3.90) and lowest in non-incentivised practices (0.17%, 95% CI: 0.13-0.22). Delivery of alcohol interventions was highest in practices signed up to the national incentive scheme (9.23%, 95% CI: 8.91-9.57) and lowest in non-incentivised practices (4.73%, 95% CI: 4.50-4.96). GP Interviews highlighted a range of influences on alcohol intervention delivery and subsequent recording including: the hierarchy of different financial incentive schemes; mixed belief in the efficacy of alcohol interventions; the difficulty of codifying complex conditions; and GPs' beliefs about patient-centred practice. Financial incentives have had some success in encouraging screening and brief alcohol interventions in England, but levels of recorded activity remain low. To improve performance, future policies must prioritise alcohol prevention work within the quality and outcomes framework, and address the values, attitudes and beliefs that shape how GPs' provide care.",False,0,,True,0

The extrusion process consists of gradual melting of solid polymer by thermal conduction and viscous shearing between a rotating screw and a barrel; as such it is highly dependent upon the frictional, thermal and rheological properties of the polymer. Extruder screw geometry and extrusion variables should ideally be tailored to suit the properties of individual polymers, but in practice this is rarely achieved due to the lack of understanding of the process. Here, in-process monitoring techniques have been used to characterise the thermal dynamics of the extrusion process. Novel thermocouple grid sensors have been used to measure melt temperature fields within flowing polymer melts at the entrance to an extruder die in conjunction with infra-red thermometers and real-time quantification of energy consumption.

Two approaches for analysing such trials are cluster-level analysis and individual-level analysis. In this study, we assessed the performance of unadjusted cluster-level analysis, baseline covariate-adjusted cluster-level analysis, random effects logistic regression and generalised estimating equations when binary outcomes are missing under a baseline covariate-dependent missingness mechanism. Missing outcomes were handled using complete records analysis and multilevel multiple imputation. We analytically show that cluster-level analyses for estimating risk ratio using complete records are valid if the true data generating model has log link and the intervention groups have the same missingness mechanism and the same covariate effect in the outcome model. We performed a simulation study considering four different scenarios, depending on whether the missingness mechanisms are the same or different between the intervention groups and whether there is an interaction between intervention group and baseline covariate in the outcome model.

The strength of the constraint drives a ``dynamical phase transition'' separating a delocalized phase, where the classical OTOC propagates ballistically, from a localized phase, where the OTOC does not propagate at all and the entire system freezes. This is unexpected given that all spin configurations are dynamically connected to each other.

While the global genomic diversity of this species has been characterized, how much of this genomic and functional diversity is maintained at smaller scales is unclear. Specifically, while several key immunogenic surface proteins have been identified for E. rhusiopathiae, little is known about their presence among field strains and their divergence from vaccines, which could result in vaccine failure. Here, a comparative genomics approach was taken to determine the diversity of E. rhusiopathiae strains in pigs in Great Britain over nearly three decades, as well as to assess the field strains' divergence from the vaccine strain most commonly used in British pigs. In addition, the presence/absence and variability of 13 previously described immunogenic surface proteins was determined, including SpaA which is considered a key immunogen. We found a high diversity of E. rhusiopathiae strains in British pigs, similar to the situation described in European poultry but in contrast to swine production systems in Asia. Of the four clades of E. rhusiopathiae found globally, three were represented among British pig isolates, with Clade 2 being the most common. All British pig isolates had one amino acid difference in the immunoprotective domain of the SpaA protein compared to the vaccine strain. However, we were able to confirm using in silico structural protein analyses that this difference is unlikely to compromise vaccine protection. Of 12 other known immunogenic surface proteins of E. rhusiopathiae examined, 11 were found to be present in all British pig isolates and the vaccine strain, but with highly variable degrees of conservation at the amino acid sequence level, ranging from 0.3 to 27% variant positions. Moreover, the phylogenetic incongruence of these proteins suggests that horizontal transfer of genes encoding for antigens is commonplace for this bacterium. We hypothesize that the sequence variants in these proteins could be responsible for differences in the efficacy of the immune response. Our results provide the necessary basis for testing this hypothesis through in vitro and in vivo studies.",False,0,,True,0

Existing methods to infer transmission dynamics from sequence data rely on well-characterized infectious periods, epidemiological and clinical metadata which may not always be available, and typically require computationally intensive analysis focusing on the branch lengths in phylogenetic trees. We sought to determine whether the topological structures of phylogenetic trees contain signatures of the transmission patterns underlying an outbreak. We use simulated outbreaks to train and then test computational classifiers. We test the method on data from two real-world outbreaks. We show that different transmission patterns result in quantitatively different phylogenetic tree shapes. We describe topological features that summarize a phylogeny's structure and find that computational classifiers based on these are capable of predicting an outbreak's transmission dynamics. The method is robust to variations in the transmission parameters and network types, and recapitulates known epidemiology of previously characterized real-world outbreaks. There are simple structural properties of phylogenetic trees which, when combined, can distinguish communicable disease outbreaks with a super-spreader, homogeneous transmission and chains of transmission. This is possible using genome data alone, and can be done during an outbreak. We discuss the implications for management of outbreaks.",False,0,,True,0

Part of the problem lies in the difficulty of extracting high-quality, quantitative measures of actin network features from microscopy data. To address this problem, we have developed DRAGoN, a novel image analysis algorithm that can automatically extract the actin network across a range of cell types, providing seventeen different quantitative measures that describe the network at a local level. Using this algorithm, we then studied a number of cases in Arabidopsis thaliana , including several different tissues, a variety of actin-affected mutants, and cells responding to powdery mildew. In many cases we found statistically-significant differences in actin network properties. In addition to these results, our algorithm is designed to be easily adaptable to other tissues, mutants and plants, and so will be a valuable asset for the study and future biological engineering of the actin cytoskeleton in globally-important crops.",False,0,,True,0

Our approach is based on viewing magnetohydrodynamics as a theory with a one-form global symmetry and developing an effective field theory for the hydrodynamic modes associated with this symmetry. In the regime where the local velocity and temperature variations can be neglected, we derive the most general constitutive relation consistent with symmetry constraints for the electric field in the presence of a strong magnetic field. This constitutive relation not only reproduces the phenomena of Ohmic decay, ambipolar diffusion, and Hall drift derived in a phenomenological model by Goldreich and Reisenegger, but also reveals terms in the evolution of the magnetic field which cannot easily be seen from such microscopic models. This formulation gives predictions for diffusion behaviors of small perturbations around a constant background magnetic field, and for the two-point correlation functions among various components of the electric and magnetic fields.

To maintain operation under failure conditions, WDNs should have built-in resilience based on topological and energy redundancy. There are various methods for analysing the resilience of WDNs based on either hydraulic models or surrogate network measures; however, not a single universally accepted method exists. Hydraulic modeling of disruptive operational scenarios suffer from combinatorial restrictions and uncertainties. Methods that rely on surrogate network measures do not take into account the complex interactions between topological and energy redundancy. To bridge this gap, the presented work introduces a hydraulically informed surrogate measure of pipe criticality for the resilience analysis of WDNs, called Water Flow Edge Betweenness Centrality (WFEBC). The WFEBC combines the random walk betweenness centrality with hydraulic (energy) loss principles in pipes. The proposed network resilience estimation method is applied to a case study network and an operational network. Furthermore, a network decomposition approach is proposed to complement the network estimation method and facilitate its scalability to large operational networks. The described resilience analysis method is benchmarked against a hydraulic model-based analysis of WDN reserve capacity. WFEBC is also applied to assess the improvement in resilience allowed by the implementation of a dynamically adaptive topology in an operational network. The benefits and limitations of the proposed method are discussed.",False,0,,True,0

Two wheat cultivars “Gladius” and “Paragon” were grown in a fully controlled gravimetric platform and subjected to either no stress or two drought cycles during the tillering stage. At anthesis, both batches were either subjected to high temperature stress, drought stress or kept as control. No alleviation of grain yield reduction due to priming was observed. Higher CO 2 assimilation rates were achieved due to priming under drought stress. Yield results showed that priming was not damage cumulative to wheat. Priming was responsible to alleviated biochemical photosynthetic limitations under drought stress and sustained photochemical utilization under heat stress in “Paragon.” Priming as a strategy in abiotic stress alleviation was better evidenced in the stress susceptible cultivar “Paragon” than tolerant cultivar “Gladius”; therefore, the type of response to priming appears to be cultivar dependable, and thus phenotypical variation should be expected when studying the effects of abiotic priming.",False,0,,True,0

We explain the relationship between DPillar and the wrapped butterfly network before proving that the underlying graph of DPillar is a Cayley graph; hence, the datacenter network DPillar is node-symmetric. We use this symmetry property to establish a single-path routing algorithm for DPillar that computes a shortest path and has time complexity O(k), where k parameterizes the dimension of DPillar (we refer to the number of ports in its switches as n). Our analysis also enables us to calculate the diameter of DPillar exactly. Moreover, our algorithm is trivial to implement, being essentially a conditional clause of numeric tests, and improves significantly upon a routing algorithm earlier employed for DPillar. Furthermore, we provide empirical data in order to demonstrate this improvement. In particular, we empirically show that our routing algorithm improves the average length of paths found, the aggregate bottleneck throughput, and the communication latency. A secondary, yet important, effect of our work is that it emphasises that datacenter networks are amenable to a closer combinatorial scrutiny that can significantly improve their computational efficiency and performance.",False,0,,True,1

Here, a strategy is proposed to efficiently yield wearable sensors using cotton fabric as an essential component, and conductive materials conformally coat onto the cotton fibers, leading to a highly electrically conductive interconnecting network. To improve the conductivity and durability of conductive coatings, a topographical modification approach is developed with genus-3 and genus-5 structures, and topological genus structures enable cage metallic seeds on the surface of substrates. A textile-based capacitive sensor with flexible, comfortable, and durable properties has been demonstrated. High sensitivity and convenience of signal collection have been achieved by the excellent electrical conductivity of this sensor.

Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)‐derived progenitors are recruited to the thymus from the fetal liver during early prenatal development and from bone marrow at later stages and postnatal life. The mechanism by which HSCs are recruited to the thymus is poorly understood in humans, though mouse models have indicated the critical role of thymic stromal cells (TSC). Here, we developed a 3D microfluidic assay based on human cells to model HSC extravasation across the endothelium into the extracellular matrix. We found that the presence of human TSC consisting of cultured thymic epithelial cells (TEC) and interstitial cells (TIC) increases the HSC extravasation rates by 3‐fold. Strikingly, incorporating TEC or TIC alone is insufficient to perturb HSC extravasation rates. Furthermore, we identified complex gene expressions from interactions between endothelial cells, TEC and TIC modulates the HSCs extravasation. Our results suggest that comprehensive signaling from the complex thymic microenvironment is crucial for thymus seeding and that our system will allow manipulation of these signals with the potential to increase thymocyte migration in a therapeutic setting.",False,0,,True,1

In order to meet the demands of the predicted population increase in an ever-changing climate, wheat production needs to dramatically increase. Spike and grain traits are critical determinants of final yield and grain uniformity a commercially desired trait, but their analysis is laborious and often requires destructive harvest. One of the current challenges is to develop an accurate, non-destructive method for spike and grain trait analysis capable of handling large populations.In this study we describe the development of a robust method for the accurate extraction and measurement of spike and grain morphometric parameters from images acquired by X-ray micro-computed tomography (μCT). The image analysis pipeline developed automatically identifies plant material of interest in μCT images, performs image analysis, and extracts morphometric data. As a proof of principle, this integrated methodology was used to analyse the spikes from a population of wheat plants subjected to high temperatures under two different water regimes. Temperature has a negative effect on spike height and grain number with the middle of the spike being the most affected region. The data also confirmed that increased grain volume was correlated with the decrease in grain number under mild stress.Being able to quickly measure plant phenotypes in a non-destructive manner is crucial to advance our understanding of gene function and the effects of the environment. We report on the development of an image analysis pipeline capable of accurately and reliably extracting spike and grain traits from crops without the loss of positional information.

Numerically, it is found that, when the vapor-phase sound speed (θV) is of the same order of magnitude as the lattice sound speed (cs), the vapor density can be generally kept around its equilibrium value. Hence, to achieve thermodynamically consistent simulations, the vapor-phase sound speed should be comparable with the lattice sound speed. Furthermore, the interface thickness in the pseudopotential LB modeling is found to be related to the slope of the equation of state in the mechanically unstable region (θM). It is shown that |θM| should be decreased when the interface thickness needs to be widened to reduce the spurious currents.",False,0,,True,0

Here, we report a new technology (Path-seq) to sequence miniscule amounts of MTB transcripts within up to million-fold excess host RNA. Using Path-seq and regulatory network analyses, we have discovered a novel transcriptional program for in vivo mycobacterial cell wall remodeling when the pathogen infects alveolar macrophages in mice. We have discovered that MadR transcriptionally modulates two mycolic acid desaturases desA1/desA2 to initially promote cell wall remodeling upon in vitro macrophage infection and, subsequently, reduces mycolate biosynthesis upon entering dormancy. We demonstrate that disrupting MadR program is lethal to diverse mycobacteria making this evolutionarily conserved regulator a prime antitubercular target for both early and late stages of infection. Synopsis A new method, Path-seq, deepens the coverage of pathogen transcripts from infected host cells. It measures non-coding transcripts, simultaneously profiles host-pathogen transcriptomes, and is sensitive enough to explore pathogen gene expression in vivo. Path-seq features the enrichment (> 100-fold) of pathogen transcripts using biotinylated oligonucleotide baits complementary to the pathogen transcriptome. Path-seq and regulatory network analyses reveal infection-specific regulatory networks for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The mycolic acid desaturase regulator, MadR, controls the expression of desaturases, desA1/A2, that likely play a role in the composition and levels of cell wall mycolates during M. tuberculosis infection of host cells. Introduction Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection occurs by inhalation of bacilli-containing aerosols. Alveolar macrophages, which line the airway, are the first host cells to phagocytize the bacteria. This initial contact of MTB with alveolar macrophages begins a complex battle between bacterial virulence and host immunity, orchestrated in large part by intricate gene regulatory pathways (Galan & Wolf-Watz, 2006; Medzhitov, 2007). As such, measuring gene expression in vivo is central to our understanding of TB disease control and progression (Flynn et al, 2011). RNA-seq provides a sensitive method for global gene expression analysis. Specific for infection biology, dual RNA-seq methods have allowed simultaneous profiling of host and pathogen RNA. However, the striking excess of eukaryotic over bacterial RNA limits the coverage of pathogen transcripts in dual RNA-seq studies (Avraham et al, 2015, 2016, Rienksma et al, 2015; Westermann et al, 2012; Westermann et al, 2016), and methods to partially enrich for bacterial transcripts have had limited success (Humphrys et al, 2013; Mavromatis et al, 2015). It is clear that more sensitive approaches are needed to profile the transcriptional state of the pathogen during infection, especially in vivo. To improve the coverage of pathogen transcripts, we made use of biotinylated oligonucleotide baits that are complementary to the pathogen transcriptome. The baits are hybridized to mixed host–pathogen RNA and used to enrich pathogen transcripts for sequencing. Approaches using biotinylated genome fragments have previously been used to enrich specific transcripts of intracellular pathogens (Graham & Clark-Curtiss, 1999; Morrow et al, 1999) or perform genome-wide transcriptome profiling of fungal RNA from infected host cells (Amorim-Vaz et al, 2015). Here, we applied our pathogen-sequencing (Path-seq) method to explore transcriptional changes in MTB (one-fourth the size of fungus, Candida albicans) following infection in mice. Path-seq data along with network modeling have led to discovery that MTB transcriptionally regulates mycolic acids during infection of host cells, influencing virulence and persistence of the pathogen. Results Development of Path-seq To enrich the bacterial pathogen transcripts, we used Agilent eArray (Ong et al, 2011) to create a custom bait library that covers all MTB transcripts at even intervals. Our MTB library contains 35,624 probes, each with biotinylated oligonucleotides of 120 base lengths. The bait library composition is modular and can be designed to cover specific transcripts of interest. Similarly, transcripts such as rRNA can be excluded or gene sequences altered for polymorphisms found in clinical strains (Fleischmann et al, 2002). For this study, we chose all transcripts of MTB H37Rv for complete coverage and comparison with standard RNA-seq results. To assess enrichment of pathogen transcripts, we first used RNA isolated from murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) spiked with 0.1% MTB RNA. A typical mammalian cell contains on the order of 20 picograms of RNA, which is roughly two orders of magnitude more than a single bacterial cell (Alberts et al, 1994). Accounting for BMDMs that might not be infected and based on intracellular sequencing studies from literature (Avraham et al, 2016; Westermann et al, 2016), we estimated 0.1% pathogen RNA would be representative of a typical in vitro infection. We performed double rRNA depletion using Illumina Ribo-Zero Gold Epidemiology Kit and used the SureSelect protocol to generate strand-specific libraries for sequencing. Half of the library was then indexed for sequencing as the ""RNA-seq"" sample, and the other was hybridized to the probes, amplified, and indexed as the ""Path-seq"" sample (Fig 1A). We performed three replicate experiments of the mock infection using the same MTB RNA. With the probe hybridization, the percentages of reads aligned to MTB were increased up to 840-fold. Both the normalized read counts (Fig 1B) and enrichment efficiency (inset Fig 1B) were highly reproducible across three replicate samples. Repeating the Path-seq method with spiked RNA samples, we increased the proportion of macrophage RNA and were able to quantify MTB transcripts from one millionth of the host RNA (1.75% of all reads aligned to MTB genomes). Figure 1. Path-seq workflow and validation Total RNA from mock infection or infected cells was depleted of rRNA, and cDNA libraries were prepared. Libraries were then either indexed and sequenced directly for host transcripts or enriched using pathogen-specific oligonucleotides bound to beads. After hybridization, enriched libraries were indexed, sequenced, and reads assigned to host or pathogen genomes in silico. Correlation between replicate mock infections. Path-seq reads were recovered from samples of macrophage RNA spiked with 0.1% MTB RNA. Scatter plot of log2 RPKM values is shown with Pearson correlation, P-value < 0.0001.

Scatter plot of log2 RPKM values is shown with Pearson correlation, P-value < 0.0001. Download figure Download PowerPoint To validate the enrichment protocol yielded quantitatively reliable read counts, we investigated the correlation between the RPKMs obtained from the sequencing of RNA from in vitro grown MTB, without enrichment (RNA-seq), and the RPKM values obtained with the enrichment protocol (Path-seq) using the same 0.1% MTB RNA with host RNA (BMDMs). Even using different library preparation kits (Illumina for RNA-seq and Agilent for Path-seq), the correlation of RPKMs was 0.92–0.93 (Fig 1C), demonstrating the enrichment process was efficient and accurate for gene expression analysis. Analysis of MTB transcriptome during in vivo infection using Path-seq method Little is known about the transcriptional state of the pathogen during infection of animal models (Talaat et al, 2004); technical challenges have limited these studies. Given the enrichment capabilities of the Path-seq method, we evaluated the use of the approach to study the transcriptome of MTB isolated from alveolar macrophages (AMs) of infected mice. We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and gating strategies to isolate AMs from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of mice at 24 h post-aerosol infection with MTB. We isolated AMs from BAL, instead of whole lung tissue, to avoid the harsh digestion step at 37°C that can alter the transcriptional state of the cells. RNA extracted from AMs in BAL of 10 mice yielded ~100 μg of total RNA. Therefore, we first evaluated the Path-seq method using 0.3 μg of BMDM RNA spiked with 0.005% MTB RNA, to simulate mixed host and pathogen RNA composition of a sample from an in vivo infection. We performed Path-seq with two replicates, and alignment analysis revealed the percentages of reads that aligned to MTB were 38 and 27%, an approximate 10,000-fold enrichment. After evaluating the Path-seq methods' feasibility for in vivo MTB transcriptome analysis, we used flow cytometry to isolate AMs (average of 4.3% of all cells and 83.1% of live, CD45+ cells) in BAL of 30 mice 24 h after infection with wild-type MTB (Appendix Fig S1A). Infection, FACS sorting (Appendix Fig S1B), and RNA extraction were repeated with three independent mouse infections (three biological replicates), yielding an average of ~300 μg total RNA per replicate. The Path-seq enrichment was performed and resulted in 17, 8, and 5% of the entire reads aligning to MTB from each of the replicates. We compared the MTB read counts between the in vivo samples with extracellular samples, biological replicates of RNA extracted from MTB grown in 7H9 media for 24 h (starting OD600 = 0.1). Both the in vivo and extracellular samples were processed by Path-seq. While the percentage of non-zero reads and total read counts are lower in the in vivo samples, the mean count per gene and coefficient of variation are the same between the two conditions (Appendix Table S1). This gives us confidence that for genes with detectable reads, we are measuring real expression levels. We suspect genes with non-detectable reads are a result of the miniscule amount of MTB RNA compared to host RNA in the in vivo samples, and not a reflection of real gene expression changes. Therefore, excluding genes with zero counts in all in vivo replicates resulted in 3,505 MTB genes (62% of genome) with sequenced expression measurements from in vivo infection using Path-seq. These results (raw data and normalized read counts for ALL genes are available in GEO: GSE116394) present the most comprehensive transcriptome profiling of MTB from in vivo infection and a major technical advancement for researchers studying host–pathogen interactions. To calculate differentially expressed genes between the in vivo and extracellular samples, we excluded in vivo biological replicate 3, which had significantly lower total read counts compared to all other samples (summarized in Appendix Table S1). The lower deposition of replicate 3 suggests a lower amount of starting MTB could be the reason for the low read count. Differential expression analysis between in vivo intracellular MTB and extracellular MTB identified 431 significantly differentially expressed transcripts (log2 fold change < −1.0 or > 1.0 and multiple hypothesis-corrected P-value < 0.05, Dataset EV1). Among the differentially expressed transcripts that code for annotated proteins (376 genes), 121 were down-regulated and significantly enriched (multiple hypothesis-corrected P-value = 0.005), in the Mycobrowser category (Kapopoulou et al, 2011) of proline–glutamic acid (PE)/proline–proline–glutamic acid (PPE) family of proteins. The exact physiological role of the PE and PPE proteins in MTB is yet to be fully understood, but they are thought to play important roles in immune evasion (Tiwari et al, 2012). It is interesting that PE and PPE genes were down-regulated in AMs and might indicate that they are unnecessary within these host cells. In addition, 255 genes were up-regulated in AMs at 24 h post-infection and were significantly enriched (P < 0.05) in the Mycobrowser functional categories: ""insertion sequences and phages"", ""information pathways"", and ""lipid metabolism"". Most interesting, many of the genes whose protein products are associated with ""lipid metabolism"" are involved in the biosynthesis of mycolic acid. These up-regulated mycolic acid biosynthesis genes included umaA, pcaA, desA1, desA2, fadD32, and fabD. In addition, genes of the operon involved in phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM) biosynthesis were also up-regulated. The biosynthesis of new cell wall material is an energetically expensive process and found to be repressed in MTB upon entry into dormancy (Galagan et al, 2013; Jamet et al, 2015). This suggests that MTB in AMs 24 h post-infection are not in a dormant state. Instead, the transcriptional response indicates MTB is actively remodeling the cell wall, perhaps with modifications that specifically contribute to survival within AMs. Interestingly, the up-regulated genes, umaA and pcaA, are required for cyclopropane ring formation in mycolic acids of MTB. Furthermore, desA1 and desA2 (with log2 fold change of 4.0 and 4.7, respectively, within AMs) encode fatty acid desaturases that introduce double bonds into fatty acids (Singh et al, 2016). Desaturation is a necessary step prior to cyclopropanation and other mycolic acid modifications. It is interesting to speculate that conditions within AMs induce desaturation events, enabling MTB to fine-tune subsequent cyclopropanation and other modifications of mycolic acids that contribute to cell wall permeability and adaptation within these host cells. The significant up-regulation of mycolic acid remodeling genes following in vivo infection was interesting and deserved further investigation of their transcriptional control. Genome-wide expression analysis during in vitro macrophage infection using Path-seq Several genome-wide expression studies of MTB challenged with dormancy-inducing stresses, such as nutrient starvation (Jamet et al, 2015) and hypoxia (Galagan et al, 2013; McGillivray et al, 2015), have shown that genes involved in mycolic acid biosynthesis are generally down-regulated. In contrast, we observed up-regulation of mycolate biosynthesis genes in MTB from AMs of infected mice at 24 h. Therefore, we sought to study the expression of these mycolic acid modification genes at multiple time points during infection using the Path-seq method and MTB-infected bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). An in vitro infection system was used due to the large number of mice required for additional time points during in vivo infection. We isolated murine BMDMs and infected them with MTB at a MOI of 10. Infected cells were collected at 2, 8, and 24 h after infection along with extracellular MTB grown in 7H9 media as control. Total RNA was extracted, depleted of rRNA, and handled as described above (Fig 1A). All extracellular MTB samples were processed by Path-seq as well. For the in vitro infection samples (Appendix Fig S2), we split each sample into RNA-seq and Path-seq fractions to evaluate the enrichment efficiency and to simultaneously obtain both host and pathogen transcriptomes from the same infection sample. While we did not perform transcriptome analysis of the host cells in this study, the raw data are available (GSE116357) along with uninfected BMDM controls and represents the first duel monitoring of both MTB and host transcriptomes from the same infection samples. The percentage of reads that aligned to MTB was consistent at a 100-fold increase in the enriched vs non-enriched samples across replicates and time points (Table 1). With an average of 11 million (M) mapped reads for both intracellular (average 13.4 M) and extracellular (average 8.8 M) MTB, we obtained >100× coverage and 5,622 unique features (including ncRNA and UTRs). This is further validation of the Path-seq method to comprehensively study the authentic intracellular state of a pathogen. Table 1. Genome mapping statistics from Path-seq and RNA-seq from in vitro infection of MTB-infected BMDMs Fraction of MTB reads of all aligned reads (%) Path-seq RNA-seq Intracellular 2 h: a 77.0 0.73 Intracellular 2 h: b 71.1 0.53 Intracellular 2 h: c 88.5 0.65 Intracellular 8 h: a 47.7 0.54 Intracellular 8 h: b 87.5 0.66 Intracellular 8 h: c 82.8 0.38 Intracellular 24 h: a 97.4 3.97 Intracellular 24 h: b 75.5 1.88 Intracellular 24 h: c 97.5 3.10 Using the normalized read counts from the intracellular and extracellular MTB data, we identified two clusters by implementing the R NbClust function (Charrad et al, 2014) on principal component analysis output, a dimensionality reduction method. The two identified clusters are shown in a two-dimensional t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding plot (t-SNE, van der Maaten & Hinton, 2008) plot. Extracellular samples clustered closely together, distinct from the intracellular samples and according to their time post-infection (Appendix Fig S3A). Biological replicates fell into related groups and demonstrated strong correlation in pairwise comparison of RPKMs (Appendix Fig S3B). Differential expression of intracellular MTB was calculated relative to extracellular, at each time point using DESeq2. Overall, there were 746, 945, and 412 significant differentially expressed (log2 fold change < −1.0 or > 1.0 and multiple hypothesis-adjusted P-value < 0.01) transcripts at the 2, 8, and 24 h post-infection time points, respectively (Dataset EV2). The most up-regulated genes at all time points included genes such as icl1, Rv1129c, prpD, prpC, and fadD19. The induced expression of these genes is consistent with known alterations in lipid degradation during infection, enhanced activity of the methylcitrate cycle (Munoz-Elias et al, 2006), and genetic evidence that MTB utilizes cholesterol from the host during infection (Pandey & Sassetti, 2008). These carbon-metabolizing genes were also found to be up-regulated in microarray analysis of in vitro MTB-infected host cells (Schnappinger et al, 2003; Data ref: Schnappinger et al, 2003; Rohde et al, 2007; Data ref: Rohde et al, 2007), along with a significant overlap of other differentially expressed genes between the datasets (Appendix Table S2). These data demonstrate that the Path-seq method yielded data consistent with published transcriptional studies of in vitro infected host cells. Importantly, the Path-seq method allows for simultaneous expression profiling of host and pathogen transcripts and additional transcript features that are not possible in microarray studies. desA1 and desA2 are induced early during in vitro macrophage infection and hypoxia time course Among the mycolic acid biosynthesis genes, only umaA was up-regulated at all time points and desA1/desA2 were transiently up-regulated at 2 h following MTB infection of BMDMs. Similarly, umaA, desA1, and desA2 were also found to be up-regulated in the in vitro infection microarray analyses (Schnappinger et al, 2003; Data ref: Schnappinger et al, 2003; Rohde et al, 2007; Data ref: Rohde et al, 2007), but none of the other mycolic acid biosynthesis genes that were up-regulated in vivo. In the in vitro infection using Path-seq, after 2 h, desA1/desA2 returned to levels similar to extracellular MTB at 8 h and 24 h (Fig 2A). This expression dynamics of desA1/desA2 during MTB infection of BMDMs was also mirrored in RNA-seq data of MTB entering and exiting hypoxia over a 5-day time course (Fig 2B). In this experiment, we used mass flow controllers to regulate the amount of air and nitrogen (N2) gas streaming into cultures of MTB and achieve a gradual depletion of oxygen over 2 days. The cultures were maintained in hypoxia for 2 days by streaming only N2 and then reaerated over 1 day by a controlled increase in air flow. During the 2-day oxygen depletion, the expression levels of desA1 and desA2 did not change significantly. However, as soon as the cultures reached complete hypoxia (0% dissolved oxygen), the expression of the desaturases increased for ~5 h, followed by a dramatic repression after ~30 h of being in hypoxia. Subsequently, reaeration of the culture returned desA1 and desA2 to basal expression levels (Fig 2B). Interestingly, umaA was not significantly differentially expressed across the hypoxia time course. Figure 2.

Download figure Download PowerPoint Gene expression comparison between in vivo and in vitro infections In addition to the mycolic acid biosynthesis gene, we further compared all significantly differentially expressed genes between the two infection models and found only a small but significant (P-value < 0.01) subset of common genes (59 genes at 24 h and 137 genes from any in vitro time point, Dataset EV3 and Appendix Fig S4). Most of the common genes were up-regulated in both models and included genes significantly enriched in categories related to the ribosome and response to hypoxia according to MTB annotation in DAVID (Huang da et al, 2009a,b). Interestingly, both AAA+ ATPases, clpX (Rv2457c), and clpC1 (Rv3596c) that interact with the ClpP proteolytic core (Neuwald et al, 1999; Raju et al, 2014) were also significantly up-regulated in both models. Despite these few similarly expressed genes, the strikingly different gene expression profiles between the experimental infection models could reflect heterogeneity in host cells. Huang et al (2018) recently demonstrated in mice that MTB has lower bacterial stress in AMs compared to interstitial macrophages (IMs) at 2 weeks post-infection. The authors theorize that different host macrophage lineages represent different intracellular environments that are permissive (AMs) or restrictive (IMs) for MTB growth (Huang et al, 2018). Our data also point toward differences in the MTB transcriptional state from macrophages of different lineages. Systems-level comparison of active MTB regulatory networks illustrates differences between infection models Given the transcriptome differences between the infection models, we employed a computational framework to characterize, at systems scale, the transcriptional differences between the extracellular and intracellular states for each model. There are numerous methods for identifying the key transcriptional networks from different environments (Balazsi et al, 2008; Brynildsen & Liao, 2009; Cahan et al, 2014). Based on one such approach, NetSurgeon (Michael et al, 2016), we evaluated the role of each TF in the observed gene expression changes given a signed transcriptional network. We constructed a transcriptional network based on ChIP-seq data from overexpression of 178 of 214 TFs in MTB (Minch et al, 2014; Data ref: Minch et al, 2015). Activating and repressing influences of TFs were inferred from consequence of TF overexpression on downstream genes (Rustad et al, 2014; Data ref: Rustad et al, 2014). Using a data-driven transcriptional network of 4,635 interactions, each TF–target gene interaction was weighted according to the multiple hypothesis-adjusted P-value from differential expression analysis between intracellular and extracellular conditions. We calculated a relative score for each TF in conditions simulating deletion or overexpression of the TF. These simulations prioritized TF activi",False,0,,True,0

The average throughputs are derived for SUs and PUs under different FD schemes, levels of residual self-interference, and number of cooperative SUs. In particular, we consider two types of FD schemes, namely, FD transmit-sense-reception (FDr) and FD transmit-sense (FDs). FDr allows SUs to transmit and receive data simultaneously, whereas, in FDs, the SUs continuously sense the channel during the transmission time. This paper shows the respective trade-offs and obtains the optimal scheme based on cooperative FD spectrum sensing. In addition, SUs’ average throughput is analyzed under different primary channel utilization and multichannel sensing schemes.

This results in models of hazard distribution that, whilst often of considerable interest and utility, are not designed to optimize cost benefits of the mitigation of those hazards. In this case study, building upon recent machine learning modelling of the geographical distribution of groundwater arsenic in India, we show that the use of objective cost-informed criteria not only results in (i) different cutoff values for the classification of areas as of high or low groundwater arsenic hazard but also, more importantly, (ii) a reduction of overall potential (mitigation + testing + health impacts) costs. Further, we show that the change in optimal cutoff values and the reduction in overall costs vary from state to state depending upon locally specific classification-dependent costs, the prevalence of high arsenic groundwaters, the heterogeneity of the distribution of those high arsenic groundwaters, and the extent to which inhabitants are exposed to the hazard. It follows more generally that using cost-optimized criteria will result in different, more objective, and more cost-relevant appropriate balances being made between specificity and sensitivity in modelling environmental hazard distribution in different regions. This indicates also the utility of developing machine learning models at an appropriate local (e.g. country, state, district) scale rather than more global scales in order to better inform local-scale mitigation strategies.",False,0,,True,0

The mass surface density power spectrum is a powerful tool to constrain the degree of structure within a gas reservoir. Specifically here, we focus on the power spectrum slope and aim to constrain whether the shear induced by a dominant spheroidal potential can induce sufficient turbulence to suppress fragmentation, resulting in the smooth central gas discs observed. We compute surface density power spectra for the nuclear gas reservoirs of fourteen simulated isolated galaxies and twelve galaxies observed as part of the mm-Wave Interferometric Survey of Dark Object Masses (WISDOM) project. Both simulated and observed galaxies range from disc-dominated galaxies to spheroids, with central stellar mass surface densities, a measure of bulge dominance, varying by more than an order of magnitude. For the simulations, the power spectra steepen with increasing central stellar mass surface density, thereby clearly linking the suppression of fragmentation to the shear-driven turbulence induced by the spheroid. The WISDOM observations show a different (but potentially consistent) picture: while there is no correlation between the power spectrum slopes and the central stellar mass surface densities, the slopes scatter around a value of 2.6. This is similar to the behaviour of the slopes of the simulated galaxies with high central stellar mass surface densities, and could indicate that high shear eventually drives incompressible turbulence.",False,0,,True,0

In this work, transition metal-doped cobalt-nickel sulfide spinels are directly produced via a continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis (CHFS) approach. The nanosized cobalt-nickel sulfides are doped with Ag, Fe, Mn, Cr, V, and Ti and evaluated as bifunctional OER and ORR catalyst for Zn-air battery application. Among the doped spinel catalysts, Mn-doped cobalt-nickel sulfides (Ni1.29Co1.49Mn0.22S4) exhibit the most promising OER and ORR performance, showing an ORR onset potential of 0.9 V vs. RHE and an OER overpotential of 348 mV measured at 10 mA cm-2, which is attributed to their high surface area, electronic structure of the dopant species, and the synergistic coupling of the dopant species with the active host cations. The dopant ions primarily alter the host cation composition, with the Mn(iii) cation linked to the introduction of active sites by its favourable electronic structure. A power density of 75 mW cm-2 is achieved at a current density of 140 mA cm-2 for the zinc-air battery using the manganese-doped catalyst, a 12% improvement over the undoped cobalt-nickel sulfide and superior to that of the battery with a commercial RuO2 catalyst.",False,0,,True,0

We propose a physical picture in which the PSSW mode acts as an additional channel for the extra energy dissipation of the Kittel mode. The energy transfer from the Kittel mode to the PSSW mode increases as in-plane magnetization precession becomes more uniform, resulting in the unique intrinsic magnetic damping enhancement in the defect-free Fe3O4 film.",False,0,,True,0

The construction of infrastructure (e.g., for hydropower, irrigation) enhances the delivery of tangible ES for example food or energy (generally provisioning) to meet human needs. However, the resulting change to river flows threatens both the ecological health of a river and its ability to provide intangible but vital ES, for example those which support the delivery of other services. Understanding these supporting ES processes in river systems is essential to fully recognise the impact of water resources development on ES delivery. Whilst approaches for assessing instream supporting ES are under development, to date few provide quantitative methods for assessing delivery. Thus, this paper sets out a framework for the assessment of instream supporting ES using hydroecological modelling. It links supporting ES delivery to fluvial hydrological indicators through the use of ecologically relevant hydrological indices and macroinvertebrate flow preferences. The proposed framework is demonstrated on the Beas River basin (Western Himalayas, India), and is flexible enough to be transferred to a basin-wide model, thereby allowing ES relationships to be accounted for in basin-wide water resources planning.",False,0,,True,0

Empirically, the paper draws upon substantive, innovative and original research undertaken with children in their homes, via a series of play ethnographies; conceptually, the paper draws upon the notion of 'domestication' and argues that ideas from these literatures might be usefully adopted as a means of reconfiguring popular geopolitics. In so doing, we argue not only that toys, games and play warrant much greater attention as forms of popular geopolitics, but also that the idea of domestication has much to offer wider conceptions and framings around popular geopolitics itself. The paper thus advances claims for a significant reformulation of popular geopolitics as an encounter between texts, objects, bodies and practices. More specifically, the rich ambiguity of the observed practices emerging from our play-centred ethnographic approach speaks clearly to the need to avoid prioritising the public over the private, cultural producers over audience, and the discursive over the affective in our theorisations of domestication. While we should be attentive to the highly orchestrated practices of anticipating domesticity and the multiple sites of geographical production assembled though these practices, we should not ignore the excess inherent within the incomplete, experimental process of domestication.",False,0,,True,0

However, little is known about the physiology and ecology of key taxa found within this region, hindering our understanding of their influence on the pathways of energy and organic matter cycling. We sampled the eight most abundant zooplankton (Calanoides acutus, Rhincalanus gigas, Paraeuchaeta spp., Chaetognatha, Euphausia triacantha, Thysanoessa spp., Themisto gaudichaudii and Salpa thompsoni) from within the mesopelagic zone in the Scotia Sea during a sinking diatom bloom and investigated their physiological ecology using lipid biomarkers and stable isotopic signatures of nitrogen. Data suggest that the large calanoid copepods, C. acutus and R. gigas, were in, or emerging from, a period of metabolic inactivity during the study period (November 15th – December 15th 2017). Abundant, but decreasing lipid reserves in the predominantly herbivorous calanoid copepods, suggest these animals may have been metabolising previously stored lipids at the time of sampling, rather than deriving energy solely from the diatom bloom. This highlights the importance of understanding the timing of diapause of overwintering species as their feeding is likely to have an impact on the turnover of particulate organic matter (POM) in the upper mesopelagic. The δ15N signatures of POM became enriched with increasing depth, whereas all species of zooplankton except T. gaudichaudii did not. This suggests that animals were feeding on fresher, surface-derived POM, rather than reworked particles at depth, likely influencing the quantity and quality of organic matter leaving the upper mesopelagic. Our study highlights the complexity of mesopelagic food webs and suggests that the application of broad trophic functional types may lead to an incorrect understanding of ecosystem dynamics.",False,0,,True,0

The lunar origin of this meteorite is confirmed by oxygen isotope analysis and the Fe/Mn ratio in pyroxene and olivine. In the present study, the clasts and the matrix of NWA 11962 are characterized by optical and electron microscopy along with electron microprobe analyses and micro‐Raman spectroscopy. The meteorite has a glassy impact melt matrix, which accounts for 35% of the surface area in the two thin sections examined, and which contains a very large variety of different lithic clasts, monomineralic clasts, and glass fragments. The presence of volcanic and impact‐related glass spherules led to the classification of this meteorite as a regolith breccia. Lithic clasts include numerous fragments of quartz monzogabbro and lunar felsite, which are quite rare lithologies in the lunar alkali suite. However, the most abundant components in the breccia are gabbroic clasts. The mineral chemistry of the pyroxenes in the gabbroic clasts and the chemistry of various types of glass fragments in the breccia indicate an origin of the regolith from an area with low‐Ti to high‐Ti mare basalt volcanism. In addition to the peculiar petrographic characteristics of NWA 11962, the possible pairing relationships with other lunar meteorites are discussed.",False,0,,True,0

Many problems of interest are axisymmetric, motivating the study of the azimuthally-integrated form of the Stokeslet which physically corresponds to a ring of smoothed forces. The regularized fundamental solution for the velocity (single layer potential) and stress (double layer potential) due to an axisymmetric ring of smoothed point forces, the `regularized ringlet', is derived in terms of complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind. The relative errors in the total drag and surrounding fluid velocity for the resistance problem on the translating, rotating unit sphere, as well as the condition number of the underlying resistance matrix, are calculated; the regularized method is also compared to 3D regularized Stokeslets, and the singular method of fundamental solutions. The velocity of Purcell's toroidal swimmer is calculated; regularized ringlets enable accurate evaluation of surface forces and propulsion speeds for non-slender tori. The benefits of regularization are illustrated by a model of the internal cytosolic fluid velocity profile in the rapidly-growing pollen tube. Actomyosin transport of vesicles in the tube is modelled using forces immersed in the fluid, from which it is found that transport along the central actin bundle is essential for experimentally-observed flow speeds to be attained. The effect of tube growth speed on the internal cytosolic velocity is also considered. For axisymmetric problems, the regularized ringlet method exhibits a comparable accuracy to the method of fundamental solutions whilst also allowing for the placement of forces inside of the fluid domain and having more satisfactory convergence properties.",False,0,,True,0

In social work however there has been little research into whether and how reflection in action actually occurs and this paper explores the possibilities and limits to reflective practice by drawing on research that observed encounters between social workers and children and families as the work was being conducted in real time. The findings show that practitioners often do reflect in action by elevating their minds above the interactions they are having so that they can think critically about and adjust what they are doing. But there are times when reflection is either limited or non-existent because practitioners defend themselves against the sensory and emotional impact of the work and the high anxiety they are experiencing. Drawing on psychoanalysis and social theories of the body and senses, the paper argues for a revision of the concept of reflective practice to take account of how the self is defended. The limits to reflection must be fully recognised while seeking ways to develop the capacity of practitioners to think clearly and critically so that vital insights about service users and the helping process can occur.",False,0,,True,0

Integrating spheres offer increased pathlengths compared to single pass cells combined with tolerance to misalignment, making them attractive for use in challenging environments subject to vibration. However, the equivalent optical pathlength can be degraded by dirt and / or condensation on the inner surface of the sphere. We present a new scheme for in-situ calibration that uses a ratiometric two-beam approach. Results are presented for an integrating sphere used in the measurement of methane by tunable diode laser spectroscopy (TDLS) at 1651nm. Reduced sphere reflectivity was simulated by applying small areas of black tape on the inner surface. At methane concentrations of 1500ppm and 3125 ppm, for areas of contamination up to 2.3% of the sphere wall, the technique reduced the error from over 50% to within ±4%. At a concentration of 6250 ppm and the most severe fouling corresponding to 2.9% wall coverage, the technique reduced the error from 55-65% to within ±11%.",False,0,,True,0

Herein, we describe a highly enantioselective, organocatalytic tandem o‐HPD‐[4+2] reaction. Our methodology utilizes a chiral oxaziridinium organocatalyst, that is available in both enantiomeric forms, to afford dearomatized products in high enantioselectivity over a range of phenol substitution patterns. This approach was applied to the highly enantioselective synthesis of (+)‐biscarvacrol (99 : 1 e.r.) and (−)‐bis(2,6‐xylenol) (94 : 6 e.r.).
