# OpenAlex Works Matching and Funder Verification

Tool for matching grant and publication records to OpenAlex works with two modes:
1. Title-based matching: Searches for works by normalizing and matching publication titles
2. Author-affiliation matching: Searches for works by matching author names and institutional affiliations

## How Title Matching Works

The title-based matching process begins by normalizing the input title to improve matching accuracy. When a title comes in as input, the matching first looks for and extracts any dates that might be embedded in the title text. For example, a title like "9 July 2019, Climate Change Report" becomes simply "Climate Change Report" with the date extracted and stored separately. The normalization then continues on to identifying and removing common title additions such as subtitles (appearing after colons or dashes), content in parentheses or brackets, report numbers, version indicators, and suffixes like "abstract" or "preprint". The text is then converted to lowercase, special characters are removed, and Unicode characters are transliterated to their ASCII equivalents. When aggressive matching is used, English stopwords can be filtered out as well.

Once the title is normalized, the system searches OpenAlex using a two-stage approach. First, it attempts an exact search using the cleaned title. If this doesn't yield results above the specified similarity threshold, it falls back to a fuzzy search that can handle minor variations in wording. When a publication year is provided, the search is refined by filtering to publications within a Â±2 year window, which significantly improves match accuracy and reduces false positives. The similarity between titles is calculated using Levenshtein distance, which measures the minimum number of single-character edits required to change one string into another.

After potential matches are found, the system validates them through additional checks. If author information is available, it compares the last names of authors from the input with those in the OpenAlex record, requiring at least an 85% similarity match. Publication years are also validated when available, with a +/- two year tolerance. Only matches that exceed th similarity threshold (default 95%) are returned as valid matches.

## How Author-Affiliation Matching Works

The author-affiliation matching approach is designed for scenarios where you have author names and institutional affiliations but may not have publication titles. This method searches for all publications by specific authors and their institutions, making it useful for tracking research outputs from grants where the principal investigator and their institution are known.

The matching process follows an institution-first strategy to minimize false positives. When a search begins, the system first attempts to resolve the institutional affiliation to a specific organization. It starts by searching the OpenAlex institutions database for organizations matching the affiliation string. If no match is found with sufficient confidence, the system falls back to the ROR (Research Organization Registry) API, which specializes in disambiguating messy affiliation strings to standardized institution identifiers. The ROR service can handle variations like "MIT" versus "Massachusetts Institute of Technology" or abbreviated forms like "U of T" for "University of Toronto."

Once an institution is identified, the system extracts the author's surname from the input name (handling various formats including "Last, First", "First Last", "Last Initial", and compound surnames like "De La Cruz"). It then searches specifically for authors with that surname who are affiliated with the identified institution.

When multiple authors are found at the institution, the system performs name disambiguation using the configured name matching style. Each name is normalized by converting Latin characters to ASCII equivalents and compared using Jaro-Winkler similarity scoring. The author with the highest name similarity score above the threshold is selected as the match. The system then retrieves publications where this author is specifically affiliated with the matched institution, filtering out any works from their time at other organizations. For example, if searching for "J Smith at MIT", the system will only return papers where J Smith lists MIT as their affiliation, excluding any papers from their previous position at Stanford or subsequent move to Harvard. This institution-specific filtering ensures clean, accurate results tied to the grant-awarding institution. Works are further filtered by year window if a grant year is provided.

When an author is successfully matched at an institution but has no publications there within the specified time window, the system returns an empty result rather than falling back to a broader search. This prevents false positives that could occur from matching similarly-named authors at other institutions. For instance, if "Mitchell G" at University of Strathclyde has no publications in 2013-2018, the system will correctly return no results rather than incorrectly matching to authors at other institutions.

If the institution cannot be resolved through either OpenAlex or ROR, the system falls back to a broader search strategy. In this fallback mode, it searches for authors by name across all institutions and then validates each potential match by comparing the affiliation strings. This comparison can use either fuzzy text matching or an embedding model (`cometadata/affiliation-clustering-0.3b`) specially trained on institution name disambiguation. The embedding model generates vector representations of institution names and uses cosine similarity to identify matches, allowing it to recognize that "Harvard Medical School" and "Harvard University" refer to related institutions even when the text differs significantly.

Each potential match is scored using a weighted combination of author name similarity (30% by default) and affiliation similarity (70% by default), reflecting the importance of institutional affiliation in reducing false positives. The matching requires a minimum affiliation score (85% by default) to consider a match valid. Unlike in the title-based matching, which produces one output row per input record, author-affiliation matching retunrs multiple output rows, one for each publication found for that author at that institution. Each output row includes the match scores for both author and affiliation, allowing the user to assess their confidence in each match.
